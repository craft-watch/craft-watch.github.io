As such, they should give us the ability to crop more out of our kettle at the Old Flax Store. This experimental beer saw us trial whether Incognito hops are a true representation of the real thing, and if they do result in an increase in yield. This beer is hopped with Incognito Citra in the whirlpool, and is dry hopped with Citra T90, Citra BBC, Mosaic and Bru-1 for a big pineapple punch.</p><p>----</p><p>In 2014 we opened the doors to the Old Flax Store, a Grade II listed building that we found and renovated into the home of Northern Monk.</p><p>We grew significantly in the years to follow, but the Old Flax Store remains the heart of the operation. If you’ve ever visited us here, you’ll know that you can look through the ground floor window to see our original tanks still in operation. This is where we brew our smaller, more limited releases.</p><p>2020 marks the year that we launch a brand-new beer series, a series dedicated to the exploratory, small-batch nature of brewing at OFS. We’ve released beers exclusive to the Old Flax Store before, but we’ve given this series a whole new identity.</p><p>The Old Flax Store Special series will push the boundaries of our brewing, allowing us to be completely experimental in approach. Since these beers will be limited in quantity, we’ve restricted can sales to two per person, to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to try them.</p><p>We don’t expect these beers to hang around for long, so be quick if a release catches your eye.

As such, they should give us the ability to crop more out of our kettle at the Old Flax Store. This experimental beer saw us trial whether Incognito hops are a true representation of the real thing, and if they do result in an increase in yield. This beer is hopped with Incognito Citra in the whirlpool, and is dry hopped with Citra T90, Citra BBC, Mosaic and Bru-1 for a big pineapple punch.\n----\nIn 2014 we opened the doors to the Old Flax Store, a Grade II listed building that we found and renovated into the home of Northern Monk.\nWe grew significantly in the years to follow, but the Old Flax Store remains the heart of the operation. If you’ve ever visited us here, you’ll know that you can look through the ground floor window to see our original tanks still in operation. This is where we brew our smaller, more limited releases.\n2020 marks the year that we launch a brand-new beer series, a series dedicated to the exploratory, small-batch nature of brewing at OFS. We’ve released beers exclusive to the Old Flax Store before, but we’ve given this series a whole new identity.\nThe Old Flax Store Special series will push the boundaries of our brewing, allowing us to be completely experimental in approach. Since these beers will be limited in quantity, we’ve restricted can sales to two per person, to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to try them.\nWe don’t expect these beers to hang around for long, so be quick if a release catches your eye. Follow our social media channels to make sure that you don’t miss out on a launch.","keg":false,"mixed":false,"sizeMl":440,"abv":7,"numItems":1,"perItemPrice":6,"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/NMBC_OFS005-1_180x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/ofs-005-incognito-ipa"},{"brewery":{"shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","new":true},"name":"Origin","summary":"Gluten Free IPA","desc":"ABV: 5.7% ABV // 11.00 EBC // 45 IBU // 1.05 OG // 330ML\nINGREDIENTS: WATER, Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), HOPS, YEAST\nA homage to the origins of IPA and the evolution of this style.
