Or a huge wedge of blueberry pie that&#x27;s been drizzled with dark chocolate sauce, as if it wasn&#x27;t indulgent enough already. We&#x27;ve built on our My Continuous Improvement base with bold additions of blueberry and maple syrup to create a smooth, luscious Imperial Stout that balances juicy berry flavours with rich dark chocolate and sweet maple. (440ml)</p><p>2 x Black Is Beautiful, 10% - Spiced Imperial Stout made in collaboration with Rock Leopard. This Imperial Stout is our contribution to the Black Is Beautiful initiative hosted by Weathered Souls Brewing Co and has been brewed with our friends from Rock Leopard. It&#x27;s built on the rich, decadent base from My Continuous Improvement with a complex spice profile that includes African cinchona bark, orange peel, cloves, cinnamon sticks, dandelion root, kaffir lime leaves, cardamom pods, tonka beans, birch leaves, star anise and caraway seeds. The Black is Beautiful initiative is a collaborative effort amongst the brewing community and its customers, in an attempt to bring awareness to the injustices that many people of colour face daily. Its mission is to bridge the gap that&#x27;s been around for ages and provide a platform to show that the brewing community is an inclusive place for everyone of any colour. 100% of all proceeds (not just profits) from this beer have been donated to three organisations fighting the injustices, crimes, hostility and brutality facing Black people in our country. These organisations are Kids Of Colour, Rainbow Noir, and The Racial Justice Network.
