You could view them as our flag in the ground.</p><p>They provide a wide range of flavours and experiences, bringing together our wealth of brewing and drinking experience and a respect for classic styles with a thoroughly modern, flavour-first approach.</p><p>A selection of 8 different cans from our Signature Range from the below list:</p><p>Small Pale, 2.5% - This beer combines our love of British beer heritage and the technical challenges of brewing lower-strength beer that&#x27;s big-bodied and full-flavoured. This is a great choice for times when you&#x27;re taking it easy, but still want a big, hoppy hit from a dry-hopping rate most commonly seen in much stronger beers. (440ml can)</p><p>Pale Ale, 3.7% - Our Pale Ale is a beer for everyday moments, whether it&#x27;s conversation with friends or quiet relaxation after work, and aims to provide balance between bold flavour and easy drinkability. It&#x27;s full of rounded tropical fruit flavours with a soft, juicy finish and low bitterness. (440ml can)</p><p>DDH Pale, 5% - Our Double Dry Hopped Pale is brewed to soup up your downtime by delivering the hop flavour intensity of our DIPAs at a moderate ABV. Doubling our standard Pale Ale&#x27;s 8g/L dry-hopping rate to 16g/L delivers a bold, juicy, hazy, and intensely aromatic beer. Out of our hoppy beer range, this sets the marker for balance between drinkability and flavour impact. (440ml can)</p><p>IPA, 6% - Juicy, soft, and bursting with tropical fruit flavours, this hazy IPA showcases a blend of bold hops and aromatic yeast against a big body from high protein malts, replicating the sumptuous, smooth mouthfeel of ripe mango. It finishes with a low bitterness to let the hop aromas and flavours linger on your palate. (440ml can)</p><p>West Coast IPA, 6% - The West Coast IPA is a modern classic that changed perceptions of what beer could be, and paved the way for today&#x27;s craft beer scene. Our own approach is informed by experiences working with trailblazing brewers and diving deep into their celebrated beers, so this delivers the hallmark layered bitterness and a clean, dry, resinous finish alongside punchy flavours provided by a blend of modern and classic hop varietals. (440ml can)</p><p>Hoppy Little Lager, 3% - Our most approachable and easy-drinking beer takes cues from both our Pale Ale and our Light Lager, to combine bright, zesty, fruity hop flavours with the light drinkability and refreshing qualities of low-ABV lager. A fine thirst-quencher, a delicious pause between stronger beers, or a great choice if you&#x27;re watching your alcohol or calorie intake.. (440ml can)</p><p>Light Lager, 3.5% - Effortlessly drinkable, refined refreshment. Our Light Lager is brewed with a small proportion of rice to lighten the colour, flavour, and body, leaving you with a refined beer thatâs easy drinking. Perfect for times that require maximum refreshment or considered moderation. (440ml can)</p><p>Step Up, 5% - Stout. Hold on a second! Itâs 2020 and weâre not here to talk diversity, weâre here to make a difference. Step Up is a delicious beer that is gonna help change who the beer industry represents, and what it needs to be. With 5% of the proceeds donated to charities and causes that help those facing societyâs biggest hurdles, and the remaining proceeds split 50/50 between Rock Leopard and Cloudwater, every can and every glass helps us make a difference. (440ml can)</p><p>Helles, 4.5% - One of our greatest technical brewing challenges lies in presenting Manchester&#x27;s water, Germany&#x27;s finest pilsner malt. Bavarian lager yeast, and classic German hops in a beer style that leaves no room for error, with no bold flavours to mask mistakes or imbalance. Malty yet crisp, delicate and refined, this Helles is a nod not just to German brewing, but to traditional beers the world over. A beer for talking over, and reflecting on its subtle nuances. (440ml can)</p><p>West Coast Pale, 4% - Inspired by the classic, easy-drinking Pale Ales of America&#x27;s West Coast, this is a style where balance between punchy, aromatic hop notes and solid drinkability is key. A clean, dry, lightly resinous and bitter finish sets this beer apart from its hazy counterparts.

You could view them as our flag in the ground.\nThey provide a wide range of flavours and experiences, bringing together our wealth of brewing and drinking experience and a respect for classic styles with a thoroughly modern, flavour-first approach.\nA selection of 8 different cans from our Signature Range from the below list:\nSmall Pale, 2.5% - This beer combines our love of British beer heritage and the technical challenges of brewing lower-strength beer that's big-bodied and full-flavoured. This is a great choice for times when you're taking it easy, but still want a big, hoppy hit from a dry-hopping rate most commonly seen in much stronger beers. (440ml can)\nPale Ale, 3.7% - Our Pale Ale is a beer for everyday moments, whether it's conversation with friends or quiet relaxation after work, and aims to provide balance between bold flavour and easy drinkability. It's full of rounded tropical fruit flavours with a soft, juicy finish and low bitterness. (440ml can)\nDDH Pale, 5% - Our Double Dry Hopped Pale is brewed to soup up your downtime by delivering the hop flavour intensity of our DIPAs at a moderate ABV. Doubling our standard Pale Ale's 8g/L dry-hopping rate to 16g/L delivers a bold, juicy, hazy, and intensely aromatic beer. Out of our hoppy beer range, this sets the marker for balance between drinkability and flavour impact. (440ml can)\nIPA, 6% - Juicy, soft, and bursting with tropical fruit flavours, this hazy IPA showcases a blend of bold hops and aromatic yeast against a big body from high protein malts, replicating the sumptuous, smooth mouthfeel of ripe mango. It finishes with a low bitterness to let the hop aromas and flavours linger on your palate. (440ml can)\nWest Coast IPA, 6% - The West Coast IPA is a modern classic that changed perceptions of what beer could be, and paved the way for today's craft beer scene. Our own approach is informed by experiences working with trailblazing brewers and diving deep into their celebrated beers, so this delivers the hallmark layered bitterness and a clean, dry, resinous finish alongside punchy flavours provided by a blend of modern and classic hop varietals. (440ml can)\nHoppy Little Lager, 3% - Our most approachable and easy-drinking beer takes cues from both our Pale Ale and our Light Lager, to combine bright, zesty, fruity hop flavours with the light drinkability and refreshing qualities of low-ABV lager. A fine thirst-quencher, a delicious pause between stronger beers, or a great choice if you're watching your alcohol or calorie intake.. (440ml can)\nLight Lager, 3.5% - Effortlessly drinkable, refined refreshment. Our Light Lager is brewed with a small proportion of rice to lighten the colour, flavour, and body, leaving you with a refined beer thatâs easy drinking. Perfect for times that require maximum refreshment or considered moderation. (440ml can)\nStep Up, 5% - Stout. Hold on a second! Itâs 2020 and weâre not here to talk diversity, weâre here to make a difference. Step Up is a delicious beer that is gonna help change who the beer industry represents, and what it needs to be. With 5% of the proceeds donated to charities and causes that help those facing societyâs biggest hurdles, and the remaining proceeds split 50/50 between Rock Leopard and Cloudwater, every can and every glass helps us make a difference. (440ml can)\nHelles, 4.5% - One of our greatest technical brewing challenges lies in presenting Manchester's water, Germany's finest pilsner malt. Bavarian lager yeast, and classic German hops in a beer style that leaves no room for error, with no bold flavours to mask mistakes or imbalance. Malty yet crisp, delicate and refined, this Helles is a nod not just to German brewing, but to traditional beers the world over. A beer for talking over, and reflecting on its subtle nuances. (440ml can)\nWest Coast Pale, 4% - Inspired by the classic, easy-drinking Pale Ales of America's West Coast, this is a style where balance between punchy, aromatic hop notes and solid drinkability is key. A clean, dry, lightly resinous and bitter finish sets this beer apart from its hazy counterparts.
