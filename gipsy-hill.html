If you buy the NHS a “pint” on any participating brewery’s web-shop, we’ll make sure that a drink gets into the hands of a well deserving NHS worker once we come off lockdown. They are true heroes and deserve to be rewarded once this crisis has passed. It’s a Pay it Forward scheme that will benefit small business as well as those that deserve our thanks.\nA small group of breweries have got together to try and geographically represent the country so you can give to the area you most want to support NHS staff in a post-pandemic world: Fyne Ales (Scotland), Wylam (North East), Cloudwater (North West), North Brewing Co (Yorkshire), Verdant, and Left Handed Giant (South West), Deya (West Midlands), Duration (East Anglia), Gipsy Hill (South East) and Boundary (Northern Ireland).\nEach “Buy the NHS a Pint” bought on any of our web-shops will be forwarded to our taprooms. As soon as we’re open again anyone from the NHS and by extension any volunteer signed up to help, can pop in, show their ID and redeem their drink.⁠","mixed":false,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5,"keg":false}],"available":true,"categories":[],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://i1.wp.com/gipsyhillbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Copy-of-Core-range-6-pack-17.png?resize=300%2C300\u0026ssl=1","url":"https://gipsyhillbrew.com/product/buy-the-nhs-a-pint/"},{"brewery":{"shortName":"Gipsy Hill","name":"Gipsy Hill Brewing","location":"Gispy Hill, London","websiteUrl":"https://gipsyhillbrew.com/","new":false},"name":"Carver","summary":"Micro IPA","desc":"This is a single 330ml can of Carver.\nA Micro IPA.
