If you buy the NHS a “pint” on any participating brewery’s web-shop, we’ll make sure that a drink gets into the hands of a well deserving NHS worker once we come off lockdown. They are true heroes and deserve to be rewarded once this crisis has passed. It’s a Pay it Forward scheme that will benefit small business as well as those that deserve our thanks.\nA small group of breweries have got together to try and geographically represent the country so you can give to the area you most want to support NHS staff in a post-pandemic world: Fyne Ales (Scotland), Wylam (North East), Cloudwater (North West), North Brewing Co (Yorkshire), Verdant, and Left Handed Giant (South West), Deya (West Midlands), Duration (East Anglia), Gipsy Hill (South East) and Boundary (Northern Ireland).\nEach “Buy the NHS a Pint” bought on any of our web-shops will be forwarded to our taprooms. As soon as we’re open again anyone from the NHS and by extension any volunteer signed up to help, can pop in, show their ID and redeem their drink.⁠","keg":false,"mixed":false,"sizeMl":null,"abv":null,"numItems":1,"perItemPrice":5,"available":true,"categories":[],"thumbnailUrl":"https://i1.wp.com/gipsyhillbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Copy-of-Core-range-6-pack-17.png?resize=300%2C300\u0026ssl=1","url":"https://gipsyhillbrew.com/product/buy-the-nhs-a-pint/"},{"brewery":"Gipsy Hill","name":"Hitcher","summary":"American Pale Ale","desc":"This is a single 440ml can of Hitcher – An American Pale Ale\nA clean grist and a classic yeast means this beer harks back to what most of us fell in love with the first time.\nA big whirlpool dose of Simcoe and Amarillo, with Simco cyro and Amarillo in the dry hop, gives you dank pine and sweet tangerine.\nGoes well with yellows, oranges, reds and purples.\nFeaturing Ciaran, our production chief and cycling savant.","keg":false,"mixed":false,"sizeMl":440,"abv":5.5,"numItems":1,"perItemPrice":4,"available":true,"categories":["Pale"],"thumbnailUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/gipsyhillbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hitcher.png?resize=300%2C300\u0026ssl=1","url":"https://gipsyhillbrew.com/product/hitcher/"},{"brewery":"Gipsy Hill","name":"Outdoorsman","summary":"Triple Fruited Sour","desc":"This is a single 440ml of Outdoorsman – A Triple Fruited Sour.\nA classic Gipsy Hill sour base beer, with lashings of blueberry and just a hint of banana thrown in.
