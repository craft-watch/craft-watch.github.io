Smooth bitterness and a sweet biscuity malt flavour.\n4 × SNORKEL Cashmere IPA • 6%\nA pale yellow, hazy New England IPA hopped with Cashmere. Silky, full mouthfeel and a soft carb. We upped the oats for this one, and we used Yakima Chief Cashmere hops for the first time, and hot damn! We're getting grapefruit, tropical fruit, crème caramel, melon. Delish!\n4 × SMOOTH BIG CAT Double IPA • 8%\nSMOOTH BIG CAT is a strong and silky double IPA. Heavily hopped with Talus, Simcoe, and Mosaic, and fermented with London Ale III.
