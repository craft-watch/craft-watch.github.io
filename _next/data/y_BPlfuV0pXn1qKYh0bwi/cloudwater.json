Its mission is to bridge the gap that's been around for ages and provide a platform to show that the brewing community is an inclusive place for everyone of any colour.\n100% of all proceeds (not just profits) from this beer have been donated to three organisations fighting the injustices, crimes, hostility and brutality facing Black people in our country.
