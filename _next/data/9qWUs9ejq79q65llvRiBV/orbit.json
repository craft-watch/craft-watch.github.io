Named after the runoff area on vinyl records, with a nod to Seven (named for the 7” single) our Double Brown Stout which we have brewed in previous winters at Orbit.\nDead Wax is our take on a classic London Porter. Based on the late nineteenth-century interpretation of the style. Complex rich malt, with aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel and malty biscuit. More chocolate, coffee and black treacle on the palate. Rich full body, robust bitterness and a subtle earthy/lemony hop character combine to create a distinctively dry and drinkable dark ruby coloured beer.\n5.5%\n330ml\nVegan","mixed":false,"abv":5.5,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":54,"sizeMl":330},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":28.8,"sizeMl":330}],"available":false,"categories":["Dark"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0360/1235/9817/products/DeadWaxAmazon_250x250@2x.jpg","url":"https://orbit-beers.myshopify.com/collections/all/products/dead-wax-london-porter-5-5"},{"brewery":{"shortName":"Orbit","name":"Orbit Beers","location":"Walworth, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.orbitbeers.com/","twitterHandle":"OrbitBeers","new":true},"name":"Elderflower Sour","desc":"Packed full of freshly harvested Haschberg and Haidegg 13 and 17 Elderflowers from Silverhill Elderflowers in East Sussex.
