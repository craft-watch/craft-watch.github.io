This backdrop inspired the fourth beer in the Haze Outdoors Patrons Project series, with conversation drifting to Haze’s memories as a kid growing up in Whitby, and his favourite treat made by local family bakery, Botham’s - Yorkshire Brack cake. This beer has been created to replicate the flavours of this Yorkshire delicacy.\nWe decided to keep things pretty simple and brew a classic English porter with a grist designed to replicate the sticky, dried fruit and earthy spice character of this Yorkshire fruit cake. Starting with a base of deep golden spring barley malt, we focused on layering up plenty of crystal malts for copious dark cherry, toffee and currant notes including Belgian Special B, a light crystal from Castleford’s Fawcett malt, and a touch of Crisp Malt’s dark crystal. Seeking deep colour and silky-smooth flavours whilst keeping roast levels low, we included chocolate malt and Weyermann Carafa Spezial, and bulked the grist out with plenty of flaked oats.","mixed":false,"abv":6.4,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.1,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Dark"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/08_NMBC_1604_HazeOutdoors_BringingYorkshireBrack-3_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/16-04-haze-outdoors-bringing-yorkshire-back-brack-porter","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"23.02 Homebrew Heroes","summary":"Shepherd's Warning // Chris Morley // English Red IPA","desc":"6.3% ABV // 1.064 OG // 30 EBC // 15 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), WHEAT (GLUTEN), Hops, Yeast\nA DISCUSSION AMONG FRIENDS ABOUT HOW GOOD RED IPAS ARE WAS THE INITIAL SPARK OF INSPIRATION FOR THE HOMEBREW ITERATION OF THIS BEER.\nThis, coupled with a quick scroll through a well- known homebrew website in search of potential ingredients, led to the question “I wonder how a Red IPA with all British hops would taste?”. The final recipe took a surprisingly traditional twist...\nThe resulting beer features three different degrees of caramel malt. Carared sits alongside light and dark crystal malts to give the beer a deep ruby hue, and a rich sweet caramel flavour. The addition of wheat and Munich malts to the grain bill then contribute to produce a full-bodied beer which is rounded out with British hops. To begin, Admiral is added into the boil, before the surprisingly fruity varieties of Olicana, Jester and the experimental CF182 (also known as Opus) are added into the whirlpool and dry hop. These provide complementing citrus flavours that pair well with the caramel base created by the malts.","mixed":false,"abv":6.3,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.9,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Dark","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/NMBC_2302-Homebrew_Heroes-5_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/23-02-homebrew-heroes-shpherds-warning-chris-morley-english-red-ipa","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"26.02 Sarah Harris","summary":"Culinary Adventures: Scarborough // Double Cone Ice Cream Pale","desc":"8.2% ABV // 1.090 OG // 10 EBC // 20 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), LACTOSE (MILK), Strawberry, Hops, Chocolate, Vanilla, Yeast\nAs we enter summer, our patrons series tour with Sarah Harris takes us to the Scarborough coast.
