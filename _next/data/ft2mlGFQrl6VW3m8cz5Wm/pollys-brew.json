This is all on show with Every Piece Matters – two of our favourite hops in Citra and Mosaic receive the Augment treatment, as bright citrus notes meld with tropical fruit punch flavours to produce an IPA which is all about super low bitterness and high juiciness. After such incredible feedback on the three previous iterations of this beer, we were itching to brew it again; this time with every one of the techniques we’ve learned in 2020. An amplified version of our phenomenally popular Citra Mosaic IPA from our dearly departed Originals range; bringing all those incredible hop characteristics to the fore.","mixed":false,"abv":6.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/12/epm-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/every-piece-matters-ipa-6-7/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"First Verse, Twice","summary":"DDH IPA","desc":"First Verse, Twice\nRange: Augment\nStyle: DDH India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.4%\nWe confess to being big music heads here at Polly’s HQ, with a huge spectrum of styles appreciated brewery-wide. Whether it’s a “Champagne Supernova”, a “Killing in the Name”, or an “Orange Crush”, there’s just something that’s always stuck in our minds about how uniquely memorable a repeated first verse is. We wanted to apply this concept to a beer, and First Verse, Twice was born. Featuring a first verse of El Dorado in the boil, we added a healthy chorus of Mosaic and Simcoe during fermentation, before coming back for another go around on El Dorado once again in the dry-hop. The result is a juicebomb of a beer, positively dripping with notes of tangerine, jelly tots (yes, really) and red grapefruit for balance.

Those base flavours from the malts, accentuated by the flavour profiles brought to the table by the hops, they all come together as the strength heads into the upper echelons of IPA territory. As a brewery that firmly embraces the past in our brewing style, we’ve employed our pyramid dry-hopping technique here with a heavy dose of the present in Azacca, before a nod to the past with a smaller but still healthy addition of Chinook, finishing with an eye on the future with a further small addition of Sabro. Expect tropical juice to meld with pina colada sweetness before finishing out with piney bitterness in this all out smasher of an IPA.","mixed":false,"abv":7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/12/se-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/surface-edition-ipa-7-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
