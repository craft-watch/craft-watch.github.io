We’re already massive Sabro converts, so it was a given that we’d be adding this, but why not throw some Bru-1 into the mix – a hop varietal we’ve as yet not used at Polly’s. Named for an “ism” coined from the brewery when we discovered all these new varietals now available, we’ve supercharged this beer with a dry hop of 40kg, resulting in freshly cut pineapple aroma and flavours from Bru-1 complimenting the pina colada notes of Sabro, and accentuating the tropical fruit notes of Citra and Mosaic in an IPA that is mega juicy, mega hazy, and mega Polly’s.","mixed":false,"abv":6.4,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/08/BT-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/bonus-tracks-ipa-6-4/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"DDH Patternist","summary":"Triple IPA","desc":"DDH Patternist\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Triple India Pale Ale\nABV: 10.0%\nWell it would be rude not to, wouldn’t it? After absolutely overwhelming feedback to DDH Spur back in early July, we immediately fastracked another of the original three Augment beers into TIPA mode, with Patternist lined up next. Arguably the most underrated of the original three, but scoring mega points for its simple, unfussy hop bill and ornate tile artwork, we’ve supercharged the hop bill on this incredible beer to an insane 60kg of El Dorado and Simcoe. Much like its upscaled sibling, this beer is about one thing and one thing only; pure and unadulterated juice. Next to zero bitterness, just straight up mango, passionfruit, and papaya to the max.

We’ve gone there with Mosaic, we’ve gone there with Citra, and now it’s the turn of probably the biggest in-house favourite hop varietal here at Polly’s; Simcoe. Ghost Voices is the final entry of our exploration into single hopped DIPAs fermented out with everybody’s new favourite super-yeast, Kveik.

We are famous (or infamous, your call!) for our passion for paying homage to all things old school here at Polly’s – tipping a glass to the OG craft beer heroes. With Informal Edits, we wanted to smash together the classic old school bite of a west coast IPA with the soft, pillowy juice of a NEIPA for a hybridised IPA that carries the qualities of both. A heavy heavy 40kg dry hop charge of Citra and Columbus pairs up with a 10 minute whirlpool addition of even more Citra for an IPA that has equal parts soft and delicate notes, with super soft juicy notes to boot, with maximum drinkability in mind.","mixed":false,"abv":6.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/08/IE-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/informal-edits-ipa-6-7/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Movies In The Jacuzzi","summary":"Guava IPA","desc":"Movies in the Jacuzzi\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Guava India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.4%\nIt’s back again!

We’ve mixed up one of our usual IPAs with masses of Guava added during fermentation.
