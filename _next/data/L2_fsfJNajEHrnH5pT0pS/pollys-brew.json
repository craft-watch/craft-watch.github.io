When designing the recipe for Fake Attentions, we noticed a pattern in that our use of the old school varietals in the dry hop bill was somewhat reserved, with the new school hype hops taking centre stage, and with that, the majority of the sensory notes. We thought “why not flip this one on its head and let an old school hop take the lead?” and Fake Attentions was born. With 20kg of Amarillo leading things alongside smaller additions of Citra, and even smaller additions of Mosaic and Azacca, this beer bursts with punchy orange, and floral notes, before the juice follows up from our new school favourites. Clean, crisp, hoppy, and downright delicious.","mixed":false,"abv":6.3,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/10/4-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/fake-attentions-ipa-6-3/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Like, Forever…","summary":"Pale Ale","desc":"Like, Forever…\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Pale Ale\nABV: 5.2%\nAhh, those super sessionable, mega smashable pale ales we love so much. There’s just something about a 5.2% pale ale that makes it perfect as an after work beer. Maybe it’s our fondness of loading them with both new school and old school hops to give that mega juiciness alongside crisp, clean bitter notes that make them so drinkable; whatever it is, there’s just a little bit of magic that happens with our beers when they hit that 5.2% mark.\nLike, Forever – named for a remark made in the brewery during a particularly long double canning day – features a ten minute whirlpool addition of Chinook, before adding more again in the dry hop.

It’s a characteristic that has become part and parcel of our beers, and we totally vibe off it. Simplify the Manifest is our latest entry into this hybridized new/old school style, with a hop lineup of Chinook for pithy grapefruit, pine and resin notes playing off a tonne of mango, passionfruit and tangerine notes from new school stalwart, Mosaic.

The two hop varietals that put us on the map with one of our very first beers, way back in those halcyon Loka Polly days. After seeing an absolute tonne of both in our hop store, the decision was made for us to go back to this holy grail pairing for the brewery. But what to do to differentiate it from that original version? Why not ramp up the hop bill to an insane 50kg, for a hopping rate of 24g/l – in other words, hop an IPA at the same rate as one of our DIPAs? Galaxy is front and centre here, showing just exactly why it’s one of the most sought after varietals in brewing today, with its passionfruit, peach, and pineapple accentuated by our similarly generous use of Mosaic during fermentation.","mixed":false,"abv":7.2,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/09/CC-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/the-one-you-cant-control-ddh-ipa-7-2/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
