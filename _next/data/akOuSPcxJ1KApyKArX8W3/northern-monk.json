So, for this Northern Sounds collaboration with Fingathing, we’ve put together this ‘Can of Whup Ass’, a DDH IPA to showcase the best of Australian hops.\nWe started with a base of extra pale barley malt backed up with large volumes of naked and flaked oats and some maltodextrin, all there to flesh out the body and bring that desirable silky mouthfeel. In the whirlpool, there’s a small US contribution in the shape of some Citra Incognito, which is partnered with a big addition of Enigma T90, the dankest of the Aussie varieties but also contributor of some prominent passion fruit notes. At the back end of fermentation came a 28g/l dry hop led by Galaxy and Vic Secret, which enhances the passion fruit aroma and brings juicy tangerine, lychee, and ripe tropical fruit.","mixed":false,"abv":6.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/10_NMBC_1406_NorthernSounds_Fingathing-Comp2_V2_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/14-06-fingathing-can-of-whup-ass-australian-ddh-ipa","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"27.01 British Culture Archive","summary":"Holidays In The Sun // DDH Double IPA","desc":"8.7% ABV // 1.082 OG // 7 EBC // 20 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), WHEAT (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), Dextrose, Hops, Yeast\nThis DIPA forms the first in a new patrons series in collaboration with the British Culture Archive. The series will be IPA focused, but also intended to showcase some of the progression in the UK hops over the past few years, pairing them with a US variety to show that homegrown varieties can deliver on many of the big, citrus flavours we love from the pacific northwest.\nFirst up we’ve selected Olicana, a variety which has been around for a few years now and still is up there amongst the forefront of UK hops. Olicana stands out for its impressive aromas of mango and passion fruit, backed up by nectarine and apricot notes, and a pleasant floral character. We paired this with one of our current favourite US varieties in Idaho 7, a real allrounder that can be relied upon for plenty of ripe tropical fruit of its own whether used hot side or in the dry hop. In this case, we went with both, as we loaded the whirlpool of this oat-filled NE DIPA with Idaho 7 before drying hopping with both varieties to a combined total of 26g/l.","mixed":false,"abv":8.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6.95,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/09-NMBC-2701-BritishCultureArchive-Holidays_in_the_sun-15_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/patrons-project-british-culture-archive","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"7.07 Esben Bøg-Jensen","summary":"Tæppefald // Mikkeller // Coffee Collective // Imperial Coffee Stout","desc":"9.5% ABV // 1.126 OG // 100 EBC // 25 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS:  Water, Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), RYE (GLUTEN), Maltodextrin, Coffee, Hops, Yeast\nFor the final beer in our series with Danish photographer Esben Bøgjensen, we felt it was only right to work with a heavyweight of the Danish beer scene to ensure this gold edition’s worthy of its title.\nMikkeller were straight on board with the idea and we quickly settled on an imperial stout as a suitable climax to the series. From this start point, we decided that we would look to select a coffee to infuse with the beer, one that would both accentuate and add to the malt flavours. On Mikkel’s recommendation, we got in touch with the fantastic Copenhagen-based Coffee Collective who were equally keen to get on board. They supplied us with their Kenyan Kieni beans, roasted to an espresso specification to bring out some extra sweetness and gentle bitterness alongside notes of caramel, liquorice, dark berry, and rhubarb. The base stout is brewed with a high portion of Château Chocolate malt, backed up by touches of chocolate rye and roast barley to add a touch of more intense roast character to the back end. Rounded out with flaked oats, we also used a range of crystal malts to bring out hints of dark berry and dashes of sticky toffee, then further bulked out the body with maltodextrin, and finally whirlpool hopped with mosaic.","mixed":false,"abv":9.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6.8,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":false,"categories":["Dark"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/11-NMBC_707_Esben_Bog-Jensen_Taeppefald-22_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/7-07-esben-bog-jensen-taeppefald-northern-monk-mikkeller-coffee-collective-imperial-coffee-stout","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"Alpha Delta","summary":"Gaia // American Brown Ale","desc":"7.0% ABV // 440ML\nALPHA DELTA's take on a North East legend.
