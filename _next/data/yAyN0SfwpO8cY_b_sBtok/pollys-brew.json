Named for the Haitian god of agriculture, and bred specifically to accentuate the intense sweet, tropical notes it imparts, we find this varietal grossly underused and underrated in a sea of more popular hype hops. Letting it do its thing in a single hop showcase seemed the most fitting tribute for this awesome hop, and in a “well, why not” move we decided to up the dry-hop bill to DIPA levels, with an insane 40kg added during fermentation.\nWrapped up in a hearty lashing of LA3 for maximum suspension, the result is a thick, juicy IPA, bursting with tonnes of mango, stone fruit, and pineapple notes, before levelling off with a healthy tickling of bitterness on the end for ultimate balance.","mixed":false,"abv":6.6,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/12/COZY-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/a-cozy-decomposure-ddh-ipa-6-6/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"DDH Pines","summary":"Triple IPA","desc":"DDH Pines\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Triple India Pale Ale\nABV: 10.0%\nOnce you’ve completed the original Augment trio, where do you go next? To the brewer’s favourite of course! A beer that was birthed from a collaborative effort with our pals at North Brewing Co last year, and an in house favourite amongst the brewers and office alike, we’ve amplified this beer to the nines for our final TIPA of the year. Going with a 10min whirlpool addition of Mosaic at 80 degrees, we opted for slightly more bitterness in this beer to counteract the sweetness from the residual sugar on the mash. Backed up with our biggest employment of our “pyramid” technique yet, with 25kg of Mosaic, followed up with smaller 15kg and 10kg additions of Galaxy and Simcoe respectively, the motto here at Polly’s is to never stop improving, and with DDH Pines, we’ve jumped a level once again.","mixed":false,"abv":10,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/12/ddhp-01-1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/ddh-pines-triple-ipa-10-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Deluxe Edition","summary":"IPA","desc":"Deluxe Edition\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 7.0%\nEl Dorado is one of our favourite hops at Polly’s HQ and for good reason. Back once again for its third iteration and in our opinion getting better each time, Deluxe Edition is our celebration of all things El Dorado; a varietal with a backstory as mysterious as the mythical city it’s named after. With an aroma of ripe mango, papaya and, in our brewers opinion, Jelly Tots (yes, really), it tricks a drinker into believing they’re in for a hype juice explosion. By the time it hits the palate, all of those amazing citrus notes we love so much come to the fore and an all out attack of pithy bitter notes rock up to the party.\nA single hop, maxed out hop bill in tribute to one of our favourite varietals; El Dorado, we salute you.","mixed":false,"abv":7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA","Bitter"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/del-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/deluxe-edition-ipa-7-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Every Piece Matters","summary":"IPA","desc":"Every Piece Matters\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.7%\nA big part of our ethos here at Polly’s is getting the absolute max out of every ingredient we use to brew with. This is all on show with Every Piece Matters – two of our favourite hops in Citra and Mosaic receive the Augment treatment, as bright citrus notes meld with tropical fruit punch flavours to produce an IPA which is all about super low bitterness and high juiciness. After such incredible feedback on the three previous iterations of this beer, we were itching to brew it again; this time with every one of the techniques we’ve learned in 2020.

By far our most well-regarded and well known beer, we’ve challenged ourselves to bring all the incredible flavour notes, mouthfeel, and aroma down to a palatable and sessionable 5%. Never ones to turn down a challenge, the brew team have knocked it out of the park with this baby version of our headline beer.

Spur is the undoubted in-house favourite of the original Augment trio, and we wanted to show just how much we love this incredible beer by bringing the ABV right down to a palatable 5%, whilst maintaining everything that made it our favourite in the first place. Our classic mash of extra pale, oats and wheat provides a solid base before the unparalleled three-way dry hop bill of Citra, Simcoe and Azacca unleash a full on juice explosion with a metric tonne of mango, passionfruit and papaya notes, before being reeled back in with our whirlpool addition of Simcoe providing an earthy bitterness to finish.","mixed":false,"abv":5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.25,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/LS-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/little-spur-pale-5-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Surface Edition","summary":"IPA","desc":"Surface Edition\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 7.0%\nWe’ve always had a thing here at the brewery for those big, brash IPAs north of 7% brewed by those old school brewers that we grew up drinking. Those base flavours from the malts, accentuated by the flavour profiles brought to the table by the hops, they all come together as the strength heads into the upper echelons of IPA territory. As a brewery that firmly embraces the past in our brewing style, we’ve employed our pyramid dry-hopping technique here with a heavy dose of the present in Azacca, before a nod to the past with a smaller but still healthy addition of Chinook, finishing with an eye on the future with a further small addition of Sabro.

This rings true for wanting to pay homage to the classic IPAs – slightly weaker in strength than our usual 6%+ fare, but retaining all that incredible flavour profile, body, and mouthfeel of what we do best. The Altar Supreme is our take on those classic IPAs – coming in at a more reasonable 5.9% but supercharged with 30kg of El Dorado and Vic Secret for all those new school notes. A beer that brings all those juicy, candied orange, stone fruit, and mango notes we’re so famous for to the party initially, but backed up with a delicious resinous bitterness for complete balance.","mixed":false,"abv":5.9,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/TAS-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/the-altar-supreme-ipa-5-9/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
