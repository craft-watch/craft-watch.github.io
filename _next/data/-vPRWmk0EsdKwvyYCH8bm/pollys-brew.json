Back once again for its third iteration and in our opinion getting better each time, Deluxe Edition is our celebration of all things El Dorado; a varietal with a backstory as mysterious as the mythical city it’s named after. With an aroma of ripe mango, papaya and, in our brewers opinion, Jelly Tots (yes, really), it tricks a drinker into believing they’re in for a hype juice explosion.

The first version of Citra Columbus was a thing of sheer beauty, and a surefire hint of where things would eventually go with our beers. A pairing of two hugely distinct and classic varietals, both of whom have bold claims to be part of the reason we exist today, this incredible IPA melds everything we love about the old school with the new school hype train we’re proud to be part of. Citra takes the lead on this one with a 20kg dry hop charge, before a follow up of 10kg of Columbus for good measure. The result?

Pushed out of the way by its more aggressive contemporary Galaxy, we find that this incredible Australian hop has a lot of similarities to its countrymate, but in a much more balanced, easygoing way. We decided to put this thought process into practice with Now Here, No Where – amplifying up the hop bill to that of one of our standard IPAs, whilst keeping things at a relatively sessionable strength. The result is a pale ale that is positively bursting at the seams with pungent tropical pineapple notes.

Upon tasting our latest effort, Patina Effect, we finally got the line we were waiting for – “Lads, you’ve done it”.\nPatina Effect is our ultimate homage to the old school American brewers without whom we would not exist today. A reeled back dry hop bill of 15kg of Chinook and 5kg of Simcoe plays those old school floral notes perfectly against the 10kg Chinook whirlpool addition – all the resin, all the bite, but with maximum drinkability.

Imparting less bitterness is something we’ve been keen to explore in our beers, and we achieved this through bringing the whirlpool temp down, and whirlpooling for much less time and adding smaller additions of Enigma and Mosaic, meaning more hops for dry-hopping! Almost 40kg of Galaxy, Mosaic, and Simcoe ended up going into this beer during fermentation, and the results stand for themselves.
