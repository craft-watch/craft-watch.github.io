The series will be IPA focused, but also intended to showcase some of the progression in the UK hops over the past few years, pairing them with a US variety to show that homegrown varieties can deliver on many of the big, citrus flavours we love from the pacific northwest.\nFirst up we’ve selected Olicana, a variety which has been around for a few years now and still is up there amongst the forefront of UK hops. Olicana stands out for its impressive aromas of mango and passion fruit, backed up by nectarine and apricot notes, and a pleasant floral character. We paired this with one of our current favourite US varieties in Idaho 7, a real allrounder that can be relied upon for plenty of ripe tropical fruit of its own whether used hot side or in the dry hop. In this case, we went with both, as we loaded the whirlpool of this oat-filled NE DIPA with Idaho 7 before drying hopping with both varieties to a combined total of 26g/l.","mixed":false,"abv":8.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6.95,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/09-NMBC-2701-BritishCultureArchive-Holidays_in_the_sun-15_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/patrons-project-british-culture-archive","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"28.01 Leimai Lemaow","summary":"Astro Gary // Rainbow Astro Belt Sour IPA","desc":"6.5% ABV // 1.0735 OG // 6 EBC // 15 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), LACTOSE (MILK), Mango Puree, Raspberry Puree, Orange Juice Concentrate, Lime Juice Concentrate, Hops, Yeast\nFOR THIS NEW PATRONS PROJECT SERIES WITH LEIMAI LEMAOW, WE’RE GOING\nTO BE TAKING A TRIP TO THE SWEET SIDE.
