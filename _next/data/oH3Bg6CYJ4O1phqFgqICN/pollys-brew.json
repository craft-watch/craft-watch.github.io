After five months in hibernation, Circadian Rhythm makes a triumphant return to our brew plans for a big summer release. A beer named in homage to the streamlining of our brew plans, meaning our brew team were edging ever closer to getting their normal sleeping patterns back after nearly two years of 6am starts and 8pm finishes; with our new brewkit now on the horizon, those sleeping patterns will be back to normal in no time. A beer absolutely lavished to the nines with an enormous hop bill of Citra, Simcoe, Ekuanot, and Mosaic; a punchbowl of tropical fruit notes, including mango, papaya, passionfruit, and just the slightest bit of grapefruit dance around the palate for a DIPA that is all about juice and low bitterness.","mixed":false,"abv":8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":false,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/cr-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/circadian-rhythm-double-ipa-8-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":true}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Flat Beat","summary":"IPA","desc":"Flat Beat\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale w/Kveik\nABV: 6.1%\nRight from the get go, we’ve been big fans of anything that has come out of Ed Banger Records in France, and in particular Mr Oizo. We’ve always wanted to pay homage to the Parisian beat masters with an all out banger of an IPA, and when designing this beer Marked it down almost immediately as a future banger.\nOld school meets new school here with floral and resinous notes from OG hop varietal mixed up with new school stalwart Mosaic for bags and bags of tropical fruit salad notes, all wrapped up in a generous lashing of Kveik for some next level complexity.

A beer specifically made with smashability in mind, Lupo Capisco is brewed with the masters of simplicity in mind – our heroes over at The Kernel, who make in our opinion the best pales in the UK. Hopped with a relatively easygoing dry-hop charge of 20kg of Azacca and Citra, this is a beer perfect for those after work pints we love so much. Soft, juicy, and crisp. These two incredible hops bring a swagbag of mango and tropical flavours to compliment their respective pithy bitter notes.","mixed":false,"abv":5.6,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.25,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","Bitter","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/Lupo-Capisco-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/lupo-capisco-pale-ale-5-6/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":true}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Petal","summary":"IPA","desc":"Petal\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 7.0%\nA beer that has been due to be rebrewed for so long, but has kept slipping through the net at each turn; we first brewed Petal back in those halcyon Loka Polly days when our Augment range was in its infancy, and the word Spendrups was a mere whisper on the wind. Fast forward to July 2020 and Petal has now been revitalised with all the techniques we’ve learned in the last sixteen months. Sitting quietly with a simple Citra, Ekuanot and Columbus hop bill, this beer strikes out of nowhere with a tidal wave of juicy, tropical dank hoppy notes before mellowing back out with a pleasant amount of bitterness on the end.","mixed":false,"abv":7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/Petal-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/petal-ipa-7-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":true}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Slow Burn","summary":"Berliner Weisse","desc":"With Lally back at the wheel, and summer fully engaged, we wanted to break out of our comfort zone somewhat and set ourselves a challenge of creating a lower abv beer, perfect for sitting back and supping in the sun. After the phenomenal feedback to our dry-hopped sour, Strange Addiction, we figured “Why not brew a dry-hopped Berliner Weisse?” and immediately put it into our brew plans. The result is Slow Burn – a Polly’s twist on the classic style, dry hopped with 15kg of Comet and Ekuanot.

For this newest version of the OG Polly‘s lactose IPA, we’re going Stateside with a full on lineup of the best hop varietals the US has to offer in Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and Azacca.
