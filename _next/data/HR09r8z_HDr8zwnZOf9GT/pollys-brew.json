We love it so much that we only bring these big guns out once in a while, and joining Too Soon, Grow Deliver Repeat, and Spur in this exclusive club now comes Brand New Only.\nAn India Pale Ale that is pure and unmistakably Polly’s – smashing together the new school juice craze, with those old school aggressively hopped beers we grew up drinking ourselves, Brand New Only brings together Azacca and Chinook in the dry hop for an IPA that hits straight up with juicy mango notes before backing up this pillowy softness with old school bite on the finish.

Our second in this series is the shortest collaboration beer we’ve ever done – brewhouse meets office with Endless Festoon, designed by our own Head of Sales, Arron. A big fan of melding all things old school and new school into a smashed up hybrid, this beer features a tag team of new school hops in Azacca and El Dorado taking on old school stalwarts Citra and Enigma for a beer that pays homage to those OG beers without whom we wouldn’t be here today, whilst fully embracing the new school juicebomb vibe we’ve become so famous for.

We’ve mixed up one of our usual IPAs with masses of Guava added during fermentation.

We wanted to improve on the wildly popular Originals version of Mosaic Simcoe, and have brought it up to Augment level with Summer Generator. Featuring twice the amount of dry-hop as the OG version, with a 40kg dry hop charge bringing all those incredible pineapple, mango and passionfruit notes to the fore, this is a beer that drinks just like Lilt for grownups.
