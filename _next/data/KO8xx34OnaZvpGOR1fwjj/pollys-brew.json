From his days creating some of the most well regarded classics over at Mad Hatter, we’ve handed the wheel fully over to our resident sour beer chief to create Another Shadow.\nA beer with one eye on those amazing triple fruited gose series of beers brewed by our pals up at North, but with a signature Polly’s stamp all over it, we’ve absolutely loaded this beer to the nines with kiwi, lime, pear and honey melon to create a massively fruit-forward Berliner with enough sourness to keep everything in check.

Our collaboration with Chamonix-based Big Mountain Brewing Co utilised everybody’s favourite hype hop Sabro for the first time and set off an obsession which continues to this day, thanks to those super complex coconut, pina colada flavours, paired up with our old faithful Citra for some citrus balance. Fast forward to the present day, with a tonne of both Sabro and Citra in our cold store, and with the blessing of our French pals, we decided to scale up Oh My… with the Polly’s DIPA treatment. An insane dry hop charge of 50kg means those juicy pina colada notes are amplified to the max for a DIPA that drinks well below its ABV.","mixed":false,"abv":8.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/09/ddhom-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/ddh-oh-my-citra-sabro-double-ipa-8-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Ghost Voices","summary":"Simcoe Double IPA –","desc":"Ghost Voices\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Single-Hopped Simcoe DIPA\nABV: 8.2%\nThe best things really do happen in trilogies – Star Wars, The Godfather, Back to the Future; we could go on.

Ghost Voices is the final entry of our exploration into single hopped DIPAs fermented out with everybody’s new favourite super-yeast, Kveik.
