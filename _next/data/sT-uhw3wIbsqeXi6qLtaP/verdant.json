This time for an 8% DIPA boasting an excessive degree of juiciness. Amarillo and Loral hops in the whirlpool set proceedings off in style, swiftly followed by a punchy double-dry-hop of Citra and Simcoe. We've tinkered and experimented with the hot and cold additions like any self respecting juice adventurers would when attempting to push those hazy boundaries. What does that mean in terms of flavour you ask? Well, you'll have to find out won't you...\n24hr delivery service from your beers leaving the brewery, not from placing your order.

A blend of yeasts offer the foundation to our latest attempt: both highly attenuate, one is clean and classic for the style and one throws peachy esters - both let hops shine! Old school US hops and elevated bitterness combine to create a highly drinkable yet assertive double IPA. Aroma is dank hop pellets, flavour is all pithy citrus, ABV is 8%.\nWe upped the hot side bitterness significantly for this brew, and we centrifuged the beer prior to dry hopping. This resulted in crystal clear beer being transferred onto the hops. We then recirculated the bright beer to homogenise with the hops before centrifuging again ready for packaging. The beer is very hazy - which is a surprise! That haze is all hop derived, no yeast or protein...just a hop haze. Most importantly, we think it tastes great.\n24hr delivery service from your beers leaving the brewery, not from placing your order.
