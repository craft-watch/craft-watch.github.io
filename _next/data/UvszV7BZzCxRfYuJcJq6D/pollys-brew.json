Our owner Sean has taken the lead on this one, employing his pyramid dry-hopping technique to full effect in this maxed out, full on DDH DIPA. Mosaic is the dominant hop varietal with a huge 30kg added, before progressively smaller additions of El Dorado and Simcoe accentuate and give this beer multiple levels of depth. Named in honour of his soundtrack for when he works into the small hours to ensure our brewers have as stress free a brew day as possible, this huge beer absolutely drips with dank, stonefruit, mango and pineapple notes, before being reeled back in by a hearty pine finish for balance.","mixed":false,"abv":8.1,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.25,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/Ama-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/amateur-dance-ddh-dipa-8-1/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Cause and Effect","summary":"IPA","desc":"Cause and Effect\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.5%\nAn aptly named beer for the times we’re currently living in – the country is going through some dark times at the moment, so we’re going to plough on brewing the best beer we possibly can to bring a little bit of light.

Back once again for its third iteration and in our opinion getting better each time, Deluxe Edition is our celebration of all things El Dorado; a varietal with a backstory as mysterious as the mythical city it’s named after. With an aroma of ripe mango, papaya and, in our brewers opinion, Jelly Tots (yes, really), it tricks a drinker into believing they’re in for a hype juice explosion. By the time it hits the palate, all of those amazing citrus notes we love so much come to the fore and an all out attack of pithy bitter notes rock up to the party.\nA single hop, maxed out hop bill in tribute to one of our favourite varietals; El Dorado, we salute you.","mixed":false,"abv":7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":false,"categories":["IPA","Bitter"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/del-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/deluxe-edition-ipa-7-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Ending Chapter","summary":"IPA","desc":"Ending Chapter\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.8%\nA recent trait of ours has been revisiting some of our favourite Originals range beers and giving them the full Augment treatment. The first version of Citra Columbus was a thing of sheer beauty, and a surefire hint of where things would eventually go with our beers. A pairing of two hugely distinct and classic varietals, both of whom have bold claims to be part of the reason we exist today, this incredible IPA melds everything we love about the old school with the new school hype train we’re proud to be part of. Citra takes the lead on this one with a 20kg dry hop charge, before a follow up of 10kg of Columbus for good measure. The result? An amped up, maxed out IPA full of those juicy tropical notes we love so much, backed up with piney and resinous hoppy notes.","mixed":false,"abv":6.8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/ec-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/ending-chapter-ipa-6-8/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Now Here No Where","summary":"DDH Pale","desc":"Now Here, No Where\nRange: Augment\nStyle: DDH Pale Ale\nABV: 5.6%\nVic Secret is a varietal that we feel doesn’t get nearly enough love these days. Pushed out of the way by its more aggressive contemporary Galaxy, we find that this incredible Australian hop has a lot of similarities to its countrymate, but in a much more balanced, easygoing way. We decided to put this thought process into practice with Now Here, No Where – amplifying up the hop bill to that of one of our standard IPAs, whilst keeping things at a relatively sessionable strength. The result is a pale ale that is positively bursting at the seams with pungent tropical pineapple notes. Keeping everything in check with a healthy lashing of in-house favourite Citra, this is a beer perfect for those lockdown Zoom quizzes and Skype pub meetups.","mixed":false,"abv":5.6,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/nhn1-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/now-here-no-where-ddh-pale-5-6/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Shaky Tail","summary":"DDH Pale","desc":"Shaky Tail\nRange: Augment\nStyle: DDH Pale Ale\nABV: 5.5%\nSimcoe, Simcoe, Simcoe. Where would we be without you? A strong contender for our in-house favourite varietal purely on the basis of how adaptable it is, we’ve utilized this giant of the brewing scene on single hop showcases across the board, from DIPA to IPA, now it’s the turn of a more sessionable effort, with us loading this DDH Pale Ale with the same dry hop charge as one of our big IPAs, bordering on DIPA territory. Featuring an insane 40kg, and with an ultra light sprinkling in the whirlpool; apricot, passionfruit and citrus notes are positively bursting out of this beer, before being reeled back in with a healthy balance of earthy pine bitterness. With everything wrapped up in a warm hug of our bespoke LA3 yeast strain, this is our love letter to one of the true superstar hops.","mixed":false,"abv":5.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/st-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/shaky-tail-ddh-pale-5-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
