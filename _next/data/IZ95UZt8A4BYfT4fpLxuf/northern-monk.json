For the return we worked with the same hops and yeast, seeking some consistency across the brews whilst also showing the versatility of ingredients and how they present differently through varying alcohol contents and brewing methods. We selected US varieties Mosaic and Azacca, as well as Australian variety Enigma, for the two brews.\nWe led with Azacca in the whirlpool, where it contributed distinct pine notes and sweet pineapple. We also included it in the dry hop to a lesser extent, letting the other two varieties lead and bring overripe tropical fruit, bubblegum and watermelon to the fore, with a classic dank West Coast character riding underneath. The grist of both beers features malted and flaked oats prominently for the silky mouthfeel they provide, and we used chit malt and maltodextrin to further boost the body of this lower ABV version.","mixed":false,"abv":4.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.2,"sizeMl":440}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/NMBC_1804_NorthSeaSession-SandyKerr-3_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/18-04-sandy-kerr-north-sea-sessions-burnt-mill-ddh-session-ipa","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"25.03 Laura Slater","summary":"Montage // Single Hop DDH IPA","desc":"6.5% ABV // 1.079 OG // 9 EBC // 20 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), Maltodextrin, Hops, Yeast\nFOR THE THIRD BEER IN OUR SERIES WITH LAURA SLATER, CONTINUING THE SINGLE HOP THEME, WE SELECTED TO WORK WITH MOSAIC. THIS HOP IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW TO THE HOP REPERTOIRE, BUT AT THE SPEED THINGS MOVE IN BREWING, IT ALREADY FEELS LIKE ONE OF THE OLD GUARDS.\nA real all-rounder of a hop, and one which tends to show more variation season-to-season than most. This hop can lead to a real love-hate relationship for the brewer! On a bad day it can smell like pickled onion crisps, but when it’s on form (as its name suggests) it delivers an array of depth and flavour which make it a prime choice for the single hop treatment.\nWe hand-selected this year’s Mosaic with Yakima Chief back in September, where we focused on finding plenty of resinous tropical fruit character whilst keeping a balanced level of dank pine underneath, and we’re happy with how this is translating through to the beer. Backed up with plenty of flaked oats and fermented with a fruity English strain, the result is a soft, rounded IPA with distinct ripe mango, bubblegum and stone fruit flavours.","mixed":false,"abv":6.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.8,"sizeMl":440}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/NMBC_2503_LauraSlater_Montage-26_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/25-03-laura-slater-montage-single-hop-ddh-ipa","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"Burnt Mill","summary":"Distant Galaxies","desc":"5.4% ABV // 440ML\nSuper Pale, Wheat & Oats make up the malt bill, providing a soft base to showcase the ripe tropical aromas of citrus and passionfruit from Enigma & Galaxy hops.","mixed":false,"abv":5.4,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.2,"sizeMl":440},{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.6,"sizeMl":440}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/Screenshot2020-07-16at12.42.04_200x.png","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/burnt-mill-distant-galaxies","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"Enter The Haze","desc":"The humble IPA has been on an incredible journey.
