Or simply follow the following steps:\n1. Vent the Keg\nVent the keg by opening the red valve on top of the keg. Lift the red handle, and turn it anti-clockwise giving it a quarter turn\n2. Getting ready to pour\nPlace the keg on the edge of a stable, flat surface. Bend the red tab on the front of the keg towards you and pull out the tap. The stem will ease out of the keg.\n3. Pouring the beer\nHold a tilted glass under the tap. Turn the tap anti-clockwise to pour the beer. Pour the beer down the side of the glass.\n4. Close the Tap\nClose the tap by turning clock-wise. It is not necessary to push in the tap after every use.\nTop Tips\nOnce opened, the beer will stay fresh for up to 3 days as long as you keep the beer refrigerated.\nMake sure that the keg is cold before you serve your beer.
