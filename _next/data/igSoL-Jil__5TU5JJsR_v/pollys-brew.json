Our collaboration with Chamonix-based Big Mountain Brewing Co utilised everybody’s favourite hype hop Sabro for the first time and set off an obsession which continues to this day, thanks to those super complex coconut, pina colada flavours, paired up with our old faithful Citra for some citrus balance. Fast forward to the present day, with a tonne of both Sabro and Citra in our cold store, and with the blessing of our French pals, we decided to scale up Oh My… with the Polly’s DIPA treatment. An insane dry hop charge of 50kg means those juicy pina colada notes are amplified to the max for a DIPA that drinks well below its ABV.","mixed":false,"abv":8.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/09/ddhom-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/ddh-oh-my-citra-sabro-double-ipa-8-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"DDH Rosa","summary":"Triple IPA","desc":"DDH Rosa\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Triple India Pale Ale\nABV: 10.0%\nIt was only a matter of time, wasn’t it?

Overwhelmingly popular every time we’ve brewed it previously, each incarnation of the headline act of our original three has progressively gotten better and better, and we’ve spared no expense on this version either. Featuring an insane 70kg of hops – ten in the whirlpool, sixty in the dry hop, we’ve given this version of our most well-renowned beer an extra lashing of Galaxy alongside its superstar lineup of Citra, Mosaic, Columbus and Ekuanot, just to give it that little push into the stratosphere.

Happily taking some on, the hop pairings they mentioned had always stuck in our head, and when we came to write recipes for our Autumn release schedule we thought to ourselves “Why not brew a beer with all the hops Bru-1 pairs well with?”, and Future Infinity was born. Utilizing mainly Mosaic in the dry hop, with a 15kg dry hop charge initially followed by equal 5kg mini-charges of Sabro, Citra and Bru-1, this beer bursts with heavy pineapple notes, with coconut and tangerine following in abundance, before mellowing out into a medly of berry notes from Mosaic, and finishing with crisp citrus thanks to our old dependable, Citra.","mixed":false,"abv":6.8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/10/FI-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/future-infinity-ipa-6-8/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Keeler","summary":"DDH Double IPA","desc":"Keeler\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Double India Pale Ale\nABV: 8.5%\nWe needn’t remind you that we love all things old school whilst simultaneously melding new school techniques into the beers we create. When designing the recipe for Fake Attentions, we noticed a pattern in that our use of the old school varietals in the dry hop bill was somewhat reserved, with the new school hype hops taking centre stage, and with that, the majority of the sensory notes. We thought “why not flip this one on its head and let an old school hop take the lead?” and Fake Attentions was born. With 20kg of Amarillo leading things alongside smaller additions of Citra, and even smaller additions of Mosaic and Azacca, this beer bursts with punchy orange, and floral notes, before the juice follows up from our new school favourites.

Maybe it’s our fondness of loading them with both new school and old school hops to give that mega juiciness alongside crisp, clean bitter notes that make them so drinkable; whatever it is, there’s just a little bit of magic that happens with our beers when they hit that 5.2% mark.\nLike, Forever – named for a remark made in the brewery during a particularly long double canning day – features a ten minute whirlpool addition of Chinook, before adding more again in the dry hop.
