It's a juicy citrus IPA with notes of coconut, clementines, lemon zest from Citra and Sabro hops.\n\"The heart of my design language definitely reflects my early interests in Japanese manga illustrations. As a young teen I was hugely inspired by manga artists such as Katsuhiro Otomo and Akira Toriyama. They both had styles that definitely stood out from the rest. Katsuhiro and his amazing facial expressions and design choices for the facial features such as his nose and eye styles, and Toriyama for his bold design choices with the large wide eyes, huge eyebrows and exaggerated muscle proportions. These characteristics really inspired me to create a design that would speak a similar language.\"\n- Cory Samuels, Artist\nYou can see Cory's other work here : @neter_krafts","mixed":false,"abv":4.5,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":85},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":45},{"quantity":6,"totalPrice":24}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0382/3671/7188/products/DDHPalecanwhite_345x345.png","url":"https://shop.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/collections/specials/products/ddh-pale-4-5","brewery":{"id":"wild-card","shortName":"Wild Card","name":"Wild Card Brewery","location":"Walthamstow, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"WildCardBrewery","new":false}},{"breweryId":"wild-card","name":"Deep Breath + Against The Dark + The Citadel Mixed Case","desc":"Enjoy a case containing all of the IPAs from this series, which includes:\nDeep Breath IPA, 5.8% - Hazy, hoppy, IPA.

The one artist that has definitely influenced these designs is Henri Matisse and his portrait of Madame Matisse (or Green Stripe). Not only is this piece for me really reminiscent of the Japanese manga art I grew to love, but the impressionists use of mark making that describe the form of the face beautifully and the extreme boldness of the painting, with the harsh reds and prominent purples.\"\n- Cory Samuels, Artist\nYou can see Cory's other work here : @neter_krafts","mixed":false,"abv":5.5,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":85},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":45},{"quantity":6,"totalPrice":24}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0382/3671/7188/products/EnigmaIPAcanwhite_345x345.png","url":"https://shop.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/collections/specials/products/enigma-ipa-5-5","brewery":{"id":"wild-card","shortName":"Wild Card","name":"Wild Card Brewery","location":"Walthamstow, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"WildCardBrewery","new":false}},{"breweryId":"wild-card","name":"Lager","desc":"4.4% abv - 330ml can\nAn unfiltered Czech Pilsner made with Hallertau Blanc hops & fermented cold for 6 weeks.
