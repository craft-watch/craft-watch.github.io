Cause & Effect is team Polly’s doing exactly what we know how to do best – hazy, juicy IPA, with a characteristic Polly’s bite for good measure.\nA healthy dry hop bill of El Dorado and Mosaic harkens back to a combination we’ve visited countless times and is always a surefire winner, Cause & Effect bursts with super ripe tangerine, mango and pine notes, playing perfectly off the pear, watermelon and stone fruit flavours brought to the table by El Dorado.

When designing the recipe for Fake Attentions, we noticed a pattern in that our use of the old school varietals in the dry hop bill was somewhat reserved, with the new school hype hops taking centre stage, and with that, the majority of the sensory notes. We thought “why not flip this one on its head and let an old school hop take the lead?” and Fake Attentions was born. With 20kg of Amarillo leading things alongside smaller additions of Citra, and even smaller additions of Mosaic and Azacca, this beer bursts with punchy orange, and floral notes, before the juice follows up from our new school favourites. Clean, crisp, hoppy, and downright delicious.","mixed":false,"abv":8.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/10/KE-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/keeler-ddh-double-ipa-8-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Patina Effect","summary":"West Coast Pale","desc":"Patina Effect\nRange: Augment\nStyle: West Coast Pale Ale\nABV: 5.4%\nWe’re all self-confessed old school fans here at Polly’s HQ, but our head of sales in particular loves all things West Coast. Constantly chasing those IBUs, we’ve sated his appetite several times over the course of 2020, but every time he’s cheekily told our brewers that we can do better. Upon tasting our latest effort, Patina Effect, we finally got the line we were waiting for – “Lads, you’ve done it”.\nPatina Effect is our ultimate homage to the old school American brewers without whom we would not exist today. A reeled back dry hop bill of 15kg of Chinook and 5kg of Simcoe plays those old school floral notes perfectly against the 10kg Chinook whirlpool addition – all the resin, all the bite, but with maximum drinkability.

Columbus Mosaic was a surefire sleeper hit from our dearly departed Originals range back in 2019, and we’re bringing it right into 2020 with an amplified dry hop bill, and a 100% new in-house LA3 strain for maximum suspension. We’ve squeezed every ounce of flavour we can out of this beer – Columbus bringing some surefire old school pine and resin to the table, before being balanced out with a whole host of dank, juicy, tropical notes from the ever dependable brewery favourite, Mosaic.

This rings true for wanting to pay homage to the classic IPAs – slightly weaker in strength than our usual 6%+ fare, but retaining all that incredible flavour profile, body, and mouthfeel of what we do best. The Altar Supreme is our take on those classic IPAs – coming in at a more reasonable 5.9% but supercharged with 30kg of El Dorado and Vic Secret for all those new school notes. A beer that brings all those juicy, candied orange, stone fruit, and mango notes we’re so famous for to the party initially, but backed up with a delicious resinous bitterness for complete balance.","mixed":false,"abv":5.9,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/TAS-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/the-altar-supreme-ipa-5-9/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"The New Renaissance","summary":"Double IPA","desc":"The New Renaissance\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Double India Pale Ale\nABV: 8.0%\nWe’re proud to be part of what is a constantly growing and evolving scene of breweries and drinkers alike. Beer as it is today is a world apart from when we were taking our first tentative steps into being legally able to drink, and an off hand phrase made in the office about the brewing industry entering into a “New Renaissance” birthed the name of this DIPA that embraces all the techniques we ourselves have learned in such a short space of time.
