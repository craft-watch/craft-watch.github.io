Our collaboration with Chamonix-based Big Mountain Brewing Co utilised everybody’s favourite hype hop Sabro for the first time and set off an obsession which continues to this day, thanks to those super complex coconut, pina colada flavours, paired up with our old faithful Citra for some citrus balance. Fast forward to the present day, with a tonne of both Sabro and Citra in our cold store, and with the blessing of our French pals, we decided to scale up Oh My… with the Polly’s DIPA treatment.

When designing the recipe for Fake Attentions, we noticed a pattern in that our use of the old school varietals in the dry hop bill was somewhat reserved, with the new school hype hops taking centre stage, and with that, the majority of the sensory notes. We thought “why not flip this one on its head and let an old school hop take the lead?” and Fake Attentions was born. With 20kg of Amarillo leading things alongside smaller additions of Citra, and even smaller additions of Mosaic and Azacca, this beer bursts with punchy orange, and floral notes, before the juice follows up from our new school favourites.

Why not ramp up the hop bill to an insane 50kg, for a hopping rate of 24g/l – in other words, hop an IPA at the same rate as one of our DIPAs?
