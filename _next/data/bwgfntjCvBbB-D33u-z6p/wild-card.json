As a young teen I was hugely inspired by manga artists such as Katsuhiro Otomo and Akira Toriyama. They both had styles that definitely stood out from the rest. Katsuhiro and his amazing facial expressions and design choices for the facial features such as his nose and eye styles, and Toriyama for his bold design choices with the large wide eyes, huge eyebrows and exaggerated muscle proportions. These characteristics really inspired me to create a design that would speak a similar language.\"\n- Cory Samuels, Artist\nYou can see Cory's other work here : @neter_krafts","mixed":false,"abv":4.5,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":85},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":45},{"quantity":6,"totalPrice":24}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0382/3671/7188/products/DDHPalecanwhite_345x345.png","url":"https://shop.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/collections/specials-1/products/ddh-pale-4-5","brewery":{"id":"wild-card","shortName":"Wild Card","name":"Wild Card Brewery","location":"Walthamstow, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"WildCardBrewery","new":false}},{"breweryId":"wild-card","name":"Enigma IPA","desc":"This beer is part of the Wild Card Project, an ongoing collaboration between the brewery and artists, designers and creatives.\nShipping: W/C 7/9/20\nA hoppy, hazy double dry hopped West Coast IPA made with Simcoe and Enigma.

The one artist that has definitely influenced these designs is Henri Matisse and his portrait of Madame Matisse (or Green Stripe). Not only is this piece for me really reminiscent of the Japanese manga art I grew to love, but the impressionists use of mark making that describe the form of the face beautifully and the extreme boldness of the painting, with the harsh reds and prominent purples.\"\n- Cory Samuels, Artist\nYou can see Cory's other work here : @neter_krafts","mixed":false,"abv":5.5,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":85},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":45},{"quantity":6,"totalPrice":24}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0382/3671/7188/products/EnigmaIPAcanwhite_345x345.png","url":"https://shop.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/collections/specials-1/products/enigma-ipa-5-5","brewery":{"id":"wild-card","shortName":"Wild Card","name":"Wild Card Brewery","location":"Walthamstow, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"WildCardBrewery","new":false}},{"breweryId":"wild-card","name":"IPA Box","desc":"12 or 24 Cans.\nContents subject to change due to availability.\nDIPA II, 8.1% - 440ml - A juicy, dank, DIPA, double dry hopped with Idaho 7, Mosaic & Citra hops.
