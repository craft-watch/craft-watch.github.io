We gathered as many cones as we could to be rushed back to the Old Flax Store to create this green hopped IPA.\nBrewing with fresh hops is not an easy task! Using the cones before they are dried means 9 times the volume is required to account for the mass of water they hold.\nWe repurposed the mash tun as a hopback, allowing us to squeeze in around 90kg of cones before filling the vessel with post-boil wort to wash through and pick up the unique floral, herbal character that they impart.\nThe wort itself was made from a grist packed with white wheat, chit malt, and some naked oats for a full-bodied and silky base. We fermented with a Kveik strain for pronounced stone fruit esters before dry hopping with a combination\nof UK Olicana and US Amarillo to complement the floral notes and bring orange zest and tangerine juice refreshment to the finish.","mixed":false,"abv":5.9,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.15,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/10_NMBC_1204_Harewood_GreenHop_IPA-12_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/harewood","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"24.03 Tom J Newell","summary":"Ghost Venom // Young Master // Imperial Stout // Red Wine Barrel Aged","desc":"12% ABV // 1.120 OG // 100 EBC // 15 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), RYE (GLUTEN), Hops, Yeast\nThis third release in the Tom Newell series was originally brewed back in February, when jess and tom from young master brewery, Hong Kong, stopped by on their UK tour.\nYoung Master are at the forefront of craft brewing in Southeast Asia and carry a reputation for outstanding barrel-aged releases, so it was a no-brainer to work with them on something decadent.\nFor the base beer, we put together an adjunct- free, rich, and viscous imperial stout which puts the spotlight on the flavours of the malt. Starting with an English ale barley malt, we added Munich malt and flaked oats to build in the body and extra mouthfeel, and then selected a range of roasted grains, including chocolate rye, to achieve a deep, dark colour, plenty of dark chocolate and light roast coffee notes, and an extra touch of earthy spice. Finished off with some crystal rye plus medium and dark crystal barley malts for dark fruit and cinder toffee touches, we had a wonderfully complex stout on our hands, which after a month of fermentation and conditioning, was transferred to a selection of freshly emptied French Burgundy and Pinot Noir barrels for six months, to pick up the rich red grape, light oak and red cherry flavours they held.","mixed":false,"abv":12,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":7.15,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Dark"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/10_NMBC_2403_TomNewell_GhostVenom-10_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/24-03-tom-j-newell-ghost-venom-young-master-imperial-stout-red-wine-barrel-aged","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"27.01 British Culture Archive","summary":"Holidays In The Sun // DDH Double IPA","desc":"8.7% ABV // 1.082 OG // 7 EBC // 20 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), WHEAT (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), Dextrose, Hops, Yeast\nThis DIPA forms the first in a new patrons series in collaboration with the British Culture Archive. The series will be IPA focused, but also intended to showcase some of the progression in the UK hops over the past few years, pairing them with a US variety to show that homegrown varieties can deliver on many of the big, citrus flavours we love from the pacific northwest.\nFirst up we’ve selected Olicana, a variety which has been around for a few years now and still is up there amongst the forefront of UK hops. Olicana stands out for its impressive aromas of mango and passion fruit, backed up by nectarine and apricot notes, and a pleasant floral character. We paired this with one of our current favourite US varieties in Idaho 7, a real allrounder that can be relied upon for plenty of ripe tropical fruit of its own whether used hot side or in the dry hop.
