Looking to brew with hops that we, as a group, can’t get our hands on as often as we’d like, the recipe took a distinctly Southern Hemisphere turn. Having spare volumes of Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy was a rare occurrence, so we didn’t hesitate in throwing them into the mix.\nWe started with a classic base of flaked oats and malted wheat, bulked out with maltodextrin to ensure a silky mouthfeel, then whirlpool hopped with Citra Incognito and T90 for a solid tropical fruit base. We fermented with our preferred IPA yeast before a 25g/l dry hop, packing in aromas of passion fruit, mango and elderflower that are backed up with zingy lime zest and gooseberry flavours, plus plenty more passion fruit and guava tropical juiciness.","mixed":false,"abv":7.4,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6.15,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":false,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/08_NMBC_2105-SKGN-DreamLineForms_Five-6_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/21-05-skgn-dream-line-forms-five-alpha-delta-pipeline-pomona-island-ddh-ipa","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"27.01 British Culture Archive","summary":"Holidays In The Sun // DDH Double IPA","desc":"8.7% ABV // 1.082 OG // 7 EBC // 20 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), WHEAT (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), Dextrose, Hops, Yeast\nThis DIPA forms the first in a new patrons series in collaboration with the British Culture Archive. The series will be IPA focused, but also intended to showcase some of the progression in the UK hops over the past few years, pairing them with a US variety to show that homegrown varieties can deliver on many of the big, citrus flavours we love from the pacific northwest.\nFirst up we’ve selected Olicana, a variety which has been around for a few years now and still is up there amongst the forefront of UK hops. Olicana stands out for its impressive aromas of mango and passion fruit, backed up by nectarine and apricot notes, and a pleasant floral character. We paired this with one of our current favourite US varieties in Idaho 7, a real allrounder that can be relied upon for plenty of ripe tropical fruit of its own whether used hot side or in the dry hop. In this case, we went with both, as we loaded the whirlpool of this oat-filled NE DIPA with Idaho 7 before drying hopping with both varieties to a combined total of 26g/l.","mixed":false,"abv":8.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6.95,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/09-NMBC-2701-BritishCultureArchive-Holidays_in_the_sun-15_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/patrons-project-british-culture-archive","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"28.01 Leimai Lemaow","summary":"Astro Gary // Rainbow Astro Belt Sour IPA","desc":"6.5% ABV // 1.0735 OG // 6 EBC // 15 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), LACTOSE (MILK), Mango Puree, Raspberry Puree, Orange Juice Concentrate, Lime Juice Concentrate, Hops, Yeast\nFOR THIS NEW PATRONS PROJECT SERIES WITH LEIMAI LEMAOW, WE’RE GOING\nTO BE TAKING A TRIP TO THE SWEET SIDE.
