Care workers look after our society’s most vulnerable individuals, often for little reward. They spend their careers assisting others, but when circumstances change, sometimes it is the carers who need some help. In recent times, their service to society has never been more greatly appreciated. Care workers, thank you… this beer is for you!\nThis limited edition of our flagship lager has been maturing throughout lockdown, 100 days in total, and the longest we have ever matured a lager for. Over that time the flavour has developed and become more refined, a perfect way to toast our nation’s heroes and help protect them too.\nThank you to our care workers from the Innis & Gunn family.\nAll suppliers involved have provided their goods at cost price to increase the donations – Robinson’s Brewery, Multi-Colour Corporation, Russell's Logistics.\nNo discounts are applicable on this charity beer.","mixed":false,"abv":4.6,"offers":[{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":25,"sizeMl":330}],"available":true,"categories":["Pils / Lager"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://www.innisandgunn.com/uploads/images/products/range/innis-gunn-brewing-company-ltd-innis-gunn-limited-edition-scrubs-charity-lager-1591011522I-G-Scrubs-12-x-330-A-1-.png","url":"https://www.innisandgunn.com/item/287/InnisGunn/Limited-Edition-Scrubs-Charity-Lager-Beer.html","brewery":{"id":"innis-and-gunn","shortName":"Innis & Gunn","name":"Innis & Gunn Brewing Co","location":"Edinburgh","websiteUrl":"https://www.innisandgunn.com/","twitterHandle":"innisandgunn","new":false}},{"breweryId":"innis-and-gunn","name":"Mangoes on the Run","summary":"Craft Brewed","desc":"This son of a Gunn is the fruitiest number we have ever brewed.
