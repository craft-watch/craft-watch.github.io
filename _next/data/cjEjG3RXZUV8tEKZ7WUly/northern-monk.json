Looking to brew with hops that we, as a group, can’t get our hands on as often as we’d like, the recipe took a distinctly Southern Hemisphere turn. Having spare volumes of Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy was a rare occurrence, so we didn’t hesitate in throwing them into the mix.\nWe started with a classic base of flaked oats and malted wheat, bulked out with maltodextrin to ensure a silky mouthfeel, then whirlpool hopped with Citra Incognito and T90 for a solid tropical fruit base. We fermented with our preferred IPA yeast before a 25g/l dry hop, packing in aromas of passion fruit, mango and elderflower that are backed up with zingy lime zest and gooseberry flavours, plus plenty more passion fruit and guava tropical juiciness.","mixed":false,"abv":7.4,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6.15,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/08_NMBC_2105-SKGN-DreamLineForms_Five-6_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/21-05-skgn-dream-line-forms-five-alpha-delta-pipeline-pomona-island-ddh-ipa","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"Alpha Delta","summary":"Gaia // American Brown Ale","desc":"7.0% ABV // 440ML\nALPHA DELTA's take on a North East legend.
