Named for the Haitian god of agriculture, and bred specifically to accentuate the intense sweet, tropical notes it imparts, we find this varietal grossly underused and underrated in a sea of more popular hype hops. Letting it do its thing in a single hop showcase seemed the most fitting tribute for this awesome hop, and in a “well, why not” move we decided to up the dry-hop bill to DIPA levels, with an insane 40kg added during fermentation.\nWrapped up in a hearty lashing of LA3 for maximum suspension, the result is a thick, juicy IPA, bursting with tonnes of mango, stone fruit, and pineapple notes, before levelling off with a healthy tickling of bitterness on the end for ultimate balance.","mixed":false,"abv":6.6,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/12/COZY-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/a-cozy-decomposure-ddh-ipa-6-6/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Ending Chapter","summary":"IPA","desc":"Ending Chapter\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.8%\nA recent trait of ours has been revisiting some of our favourite Originals range beers and giving them the full Augment treatment. The first version of Citra Columbus was a thing of sheer beauty, and a surefire hint of where things would eventually go with our beers. A pairing of two hugely distinct and classic varietals, both of whom have bold claims to be part of the reason we exist today, this incredible IPA melds everything we love about the old school with the new school hype train we’re proud to be part of. Citra takes the lead on this one with a 20kg dry hop charge, before a follow up of 10kg of Columbus for good measure. The result? An amped up, maxed out IPA full of those juicy tropical notes we love so much, backed up with piney and resinous hoppy notes.","mixed":false,"abv":6.8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/ec-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/ending-chapter-ipa-6-8/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Little Rosa","summary":"Pale Ale","desc":"Little Rosa\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Pale Ale\nABV: 5.0%\nMuch like our efforts with TIPA versions of our original trio of Augment beers, it was only a matter of time until we completed our trilogy of condensed versions – finished here with Little Rosa. By far our most well-regarded and well known beer, we’ve challenged ourselves to bring all the incredible flavour notes, mouthfeel, and aroma down to a palatable and sessionable 5%. Never ones to turn down a challenge, the brew team have knocked it out of the park with this baby version of our headline beer. Featuring a fully reeled back 20kg hop bill of Mosaic, Enigma and Citra, and wrapped up in a big warm hug of our bespoke LA3 yeast strain, this beer, much like its bigger sibling blooms with a bouquet of all things dank and juicy but at a sensible and sessionable ABV.","mixed":false,"abv":5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.25,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/12/LR-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/little-rosa-pale-ale-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Little Spur","summary":"Pale","desc":"Little Spur\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Pale Ale\nABV: 5.0%\nIn the same way that we love to scale up our beers, we likewise love to take on the challenge to see if we can fulfil the flavour intensity and body of one of our IPAs, but reeled back to a sessionable strength. Spur is the undoubted in-house favourite of the original Augment trio, and we wanted to show just how much we love this incredible beer by bringing the ABV right down to a palatable 5%, whilst maintaining everything that made it our favourite in the first place. Our classic mash of extra pale, oats and wheat provides a solid base before the unparalleled three-way dry hop bill of Citra, Simcoe and Azacca unleash a full on juice explosion with a metric tonne of mango, passionfruit and papaya notes, before being reeled back in with our whirlpool addition of Simcoe providing an earthy bitterness to finish.","mixed":false,"abv":5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.25,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/LS-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/little-spur-pale-5-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"The Altar Supreme","summary":"IPA","desc":"The Altar Supreme\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 5.9%\nWe’ve said it once and we’ll say it again, we love paying homage to the OGs of brewing – the brewers who produced the beers without which we wouldn’t be here today. This rings true for wanting to pay homage to the classic IPAs – slightly weaker in strength than our usual 6%+ fare, but retaining all that incredible flavour profile, body, and mouthfeel of what we do best. The Altar Supreme is our take on those classic IPAs – coming in at a more reasonable 5.9% but supercharged with 30kg of El Dorado and Vic Secret for all those new school notes. A beer that brings all those juicy, candied orange, stone fruit, and mango notes we’re so famous for to the party initially, but backed up with a delicious resinous bitterness for complete balance.","mixed":false,"abv":5.9,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/TAS-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/the-altar-supreme-ipa-5-9/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
