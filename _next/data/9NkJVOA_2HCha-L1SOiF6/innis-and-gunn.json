In recent times, their service to society has never been more greatly appreciated. Care workers, thank you… this beer is for you!\nThis limited edition of our flagship lager has been maturing throughout lockdown, 100 days in total, and the longest we have ever matured a lager for. Over that time the flavour has developed and become more refined, a perfect way to toast our nation’s heroes and help protect them too.\nThank you to our care workers from the Innis & Gunn family.\nAll suppliers involved have provided their goods at cost price to increase the donations – Robinson’s Brewery, Multi-Colour Corporation, Russell's Logistics.\nNo discounts are applicable on this charity beer.","mixed":false,"abv":4.6,"offers":[{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":25,"sizeMl":330}],"available":true,"categories":["Pils / Lager"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://www.innisandgunn.com/uploads/images/products/range/innis-gunn-brewing-company-ltd-innis-gunn-limited-edition-scrubs-charity-lager-1591011522I-G-Scrubs-12-x-330-A-1-.png","url":"https://www.innisandgunn.com/item/287/InnisGunn/Limited-Edition-Scrubs-Charity-Lager-Beer.html","brewery":{"id":"innis-and-gunn","shortName":"Innis & Gunn","name":"Innis & Gunn Brewing Co","location":"Edinburgh","websiteUrl":"https://www.innisandgunn.com/","twitterHandle":"innisandgunn","new":false}},{"breweryId":"innis-and-gunn","name":"Ossian","summary":"Inveralmond Brewery","desc":"This refreshing golden ale is a multi-award winning all-time favourite.
