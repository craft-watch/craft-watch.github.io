From his days creating some of the most well regarded classics over at Mad Hatter, we’ve handed the wheel fully over to our resident sour beer chief to create Another Shadow.\nA beer with one eye on those amazing triple fruited gose series of beers brewed by our pals up at North, but with a signature Polly’s stamp all over it, we’ve absolutely loaded this beer to the nines with kiwi, lime, pear and honey melon to create a massively fruit-forward Berliner with enough sourness to keep everything in check.

We’ve gone there with Mosaic, we’ve gone there with Citra, and now it’s the turn of probably the biggest in-house favourite hop varietal here at Polly’s; Simcoe. Ghost Voices is the final entry of our exploration into single hopped DIPAs fermented out with everybody’s new favourite super-yeast, Kveik.

It’s a characteristic that has become part and parcel of our beers, and we totally vibe off it. Simplify the Manifest is our latest entry into this hybridized new/old school style, with a hop lineup of Chinook for pithy grapefruit, pine and resin notes playing off a tonne of mango, passionfruit and tangerine notes from new school stalwart, Mosaic.

Go big or go home, and brew up a huge DIPA. A big three-C classic hop combo of Chinook, Citra and Columbus are at play in this loving homage to the OG craft trailblazers of America, without whom we wouldn’t exist today. A DIPA in perfect balance – sweet, biscuity malts initially, before an onslaught of piney, resinous hops, rounding off with a lingering bitter finish.
