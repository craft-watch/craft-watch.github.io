A strong contender for new favourite in-house IPA; Dry Hope is Team Polly’s taking it up a level once again. Employing a technique devised by our owner Sean to “Pyramid” the dry-hop bill. We started this beer with 20kg of Mosaic, later adding 10kg of Sabro, before finally adding our last addition – 5kg of Citra. The result is an aroma explosion of a beer – positively Sabro, but not majority so. The support hops are all there in abundance, Mosaic brings pungent, dank, juicy notes initially, before a full on pina colada explosion of flavour from the Sabro addition begins to dominate, before rounding off with just the faintest citrus, resin notes from classic C hop Citra. A revolution of a technique in the brewhouse, and one that we’re now keen to explore in more beers.","mixed":false,"abv":7.2,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/10/1-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/dry-hope-ipa-7-2/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Fake Attentions","summary":"IPA","desc":"Fake Attentions\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.3%\nWe needn’t remind you that we love all things old school whilst simultaneously melding new school techniques into the beers we create. When designing the recipe for Fake Attentions, we noticed a pattern in that our use of the old school varietals in the dry hop bill was somewhat reserved, with the new school hype hops taking centre stage, and with that, the majority of the sensory notes. We thought “why not flip this one on its head and let an old school hop take the lead?” and Fake Attentions was born. With 20kg of Amarillo leading things alongside smaller additions of Citra, and even smaller additions of Mosaic and Azacca, this beer bursts with punchy orange, and floral notes, before the juice follows up from our new school favourites.

There’s just something about a 5.2% pale ale that makes it perfect as an after work beer. Maybe it’s our fondness of loading them with both new school and old school hops to give that mega juiciness alongside crisp, clean bitter notes that make them so drinkable; whatever it is, there’s just a little bit of magic that happens with our beers when they hit that 5.2% mark.\nLike, Forever – named for a remark made in the brewery during a particularly long double canning day – features a ten minute whirlpool addition of Chinook, before adding more again in the dry hop.

Our last collaboration before lockdown with our super pals over at Big Mountain Brewing, and a surefire cult favourite makes its triumphant return to our lineup. After ramping it up to a DIPA, we yearned for the wonderful complexity of the original version. Originally our first foray into using everybody’s new favourite hype hop Sabro in one of our beers, version two sees us with six months worth of experience in the little quirks and idiosyncrasies of this incredible varietal.\nAmplified up to the max, Sabro brings a metric tonne of sweet, creamy, pineapple and coconut notes before being reeled in by an in-house Polly’s favourite in Citra to keep everything balanced.

The two hop varietals that put us on the map with one of our very first beers, way back in those halcyon Loka Polly days. After seeing an absolute tonne of both in our hop store, the decision was made for us to go back to this holy grail pairing for the brewery. But what to do to differentiate it from that original version? Why not ramp up the hop bill to an insane 50kg, for a hopping rate of 24g/l – in other words, hop an IPA at the same rate as one of our DIPAs? Galaxy is front and centre here, showing just exactly why it’s one of the most sought after varietals in brewing today, with its passionfruit, peach, and pineapple accentuated by our similarly generous use of Mosaic during fermentation.","mixed":false,"abv":7.2,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":false,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/09/CC-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/the-one-you-cant-control-ddh-ipa-7-2/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
