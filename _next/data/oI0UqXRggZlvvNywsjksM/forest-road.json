Colour of pastel wheat- as light as we can possibly get it. The fluffy texture presents a soft and elegant perfume of spring flowers, stone fruit and citrus with a hint of minerality and fresh wheat. Drinks very clean- perfect for non-beer drinkers or lager converts.\nHOW DOES IT DO IT?\nWe use the lightest barley malts and wheats combined with simple sugar to keep this beer as light as possible. An ample smattering of four English Hop varieties (which have fallen out of favour in recent years, but we love: First Gold, Goldings, Northdown and Admiral) provide a nuanced, floral aroma. It’s old school with a fresh, modern approach.\nProof of age and signature required on receipt.","mixed":false,"abv":3.8,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":46,"sizeMl":330,"format":"CAN"},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":25,"sizeMl":330,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pils / Lager"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0019/2226/9245/products/easycanshopify_200x.png","url":"https://forest-road.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/easy-pale-ale-24-pack-can","brewery":{"id":"forest-road","shortName":"Forest Road","name":"Forest Road Brewing Co","location":"Hackney, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.forestroad.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"ForestRoadBrew","new":false}},{"breweryId":"forest-road","name":"Forest Road Mixed","desc":"4x Posh Lager\n4x Easy Pale Ale\n4x Work IPA","mixed":true,"offers":[{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":24,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","Pils / Lager","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0019/2226/9245/products/mixedcanpack_200x.png","url":"https://forest-road.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/forest-road-mixed-12-pack-can","brewery":{"id":"forest-road","shortName":"Forest Road","name":"Forest Road Brewing Co","location":"Hackney, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.forestroad.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"ForestRoadBrew","new":false}},{"breweryId":"forest-road","name":"Posh","desc":"POSH (Lager Beer)- 4.1% ABV\nWHAT DOES IT DO?\nClean, simple, approachable drinking. Lager as everyone knows it- from Macro to Munich. The flavour profile is uncluttered and unpretentious. Makes the drinker think about ordering another before the pint is even finished. Serve this cold and to please all imbibers imaginable.\nHOW DOES IT DO IT?\nDry in body, but malt driven. UK grown hops are added to bolster and balance the sweetness pitch perfectly, not to batter the drinkers taste buds. Unlike many modern “Craft Breweries”, we leave our ego at the door with this beer- it’s all about you and the good times you accompany it with.\nProof of age and signature required on receipt.","mixed":false,"abv":4.1,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":31.5,"sizeMl":330,"format":"CAN"},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":17.25,"sizeMl":330,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pils / Lager"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0019/2226/9245/products/posh3_200x.png","url":"https://forest-road.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/posh-4-1-6-pack","brewery":{"id":"forest-road","shortName":"Forest Road","name":"Forest Road Brewing Co","location":"Hackney, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.forestroad.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"ForestRoadBrew","new":false}},{"breweryId":"forest-road","name":"Stay Home Lager","desc":"£1 DONATED TO NHS FOR EVERY BOTTLE SOLD\nStay HOME Lager is a collaboration brew that blends our very own POSH Lager (4.1%) with Cameron's house lager, with a classic, easy going flavour.\nMALT: Pilsner, Wheat\nHOPS: Perle, Challenger & Saaz\nYEAST: Lager Yeast\nABV - 3.9%\nCOLOR - 9º EBC\nRpH - 4.3\nOriginal Extract - 9.7º P\nResidual (Apparent) Extract - 1.7º P\nProof of age and signature required on receipt.","mixed":false,"abv":4.1,"offers":[{"quantity":24,"totalPrice":30,"format":"BOTTLE"},{"quantity":12,"totalPrice":18,"format":"BOTTLE"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pils / Lager"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0019/2226/9245/products/home_200x.png","url":"https://forest-road.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/stay-home-lager-bottle","brewery":{"id":"forest-road","shortName":"Forest Road","name":"Forest Road Brewing Co","location":"Hackney, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.forestroad.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"ForestRoadBrew","new":false}},{"breweryId":"forest-road","name":"Work I.P.A.","desc":"WORK (I.P.A.)- 5.4% ABV\nWHAT DOES IT DO?\nThe brew that launched the company, and with good reason. Like all our beers, WORK draws people in with a delicious and addictive flavour profile that begs to be quaffed. It bridges the gap between traditional British Ales and modern craft with rich malt flavour that marries perfectly with a resinous, piney aroma with overtones of orange blossom. The result is lip smackingly moreish- one to watch at 5.4%!\nHOW DOES IT DO IT?\nSpecial B is our secret weapon in the malt department. The small kiss added gives the beer depth and character without being cloying. As always, we don’t chase trends with the design of this beer and use classic hops that built the great US Breweries over the last 40 years- Cascade, Centennial, Chinook and Columbus.
