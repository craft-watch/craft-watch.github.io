Our second in this series is the shortest collaboration beer we’ve ever done – brewhouse meets office with Endless Festoon, designed by our own Head of Sales, Arron. A big fan of melding all things old school and new school into a smashed up hybrid, this beer features a tag team of new school hops in Azacca and El Dorado taking on old school stalwarts Citra and Enigma for a beer that pays homage to those OG beers without whom we wouldn’t be here today, whilst fully embracing the new school juicebomb vibe we’ve become so famous for. Stonefruits, tangerine and piney resin notes are about in this all out smasher of a DDH Pale.","mixed":false,"abv":5.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/endless-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/endless-festoon-ddh-pale-5-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Flat Beat","summary":"IPA","desc":"Flat Beat\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale w/Kveik\nABV: 6.1%\nRight from the get go, we’ve been big fans of anything that has come out of Ed Banger Records in France, and in particular Mr Oizo. We’ve always wanted to pay homage to the Parisian beat masters with an all out banger of an IPA, and when designing this beer Marked it down almost immediately as a future banger.\nOld school meets new school here with floral and resinous notes from OG hop varietal mixed up with new school stalwart Mosaic for bags and bags of tropical fruit salad notes, all wrapped up in a generous lashing of Kveik for some next level complexity.

A beer specifically made with smashability in mind, Lupo Capisco is brewed with the masters of simplicity in mind – our heroes over at The Kernel, who make in our opinion the best pales in the UK. Hopped with a relatively easygoing dry-hop charge of 20kg of Azacca and Citra, this is a beer perfect for those after work pints we love so much. Soft, juicy, and crisp. These two incredible hops bring a swagbag of mango and tropical flavours to compliment their respective pithy bitter notes.","mixed":false,"abv":5.6,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.25,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","Bitter","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/Lupo-Capisco-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/lupo-capisco-pale-ale-5-6/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Summer Generator","summary":"IPA","desc":"Summer Generator\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.2%\nMosaic and Simcoe is a partnership made in heaven. Much like Dre and Snoop, Lennon and McCartney, and Han Solo and Chewbacca, they just go together like a hand in a glove. We wanted to improve on the wildly popular Originals version of Mosaic Simcoe, and have brought it up to Augment level with Summer Generator. Featuring twice the amount of dry-hop as the OG version, with a 40kg dry hop charge bringing all those incredible pineapple, mango and passionfruit notes to the fore, this is a beer that drinks just like Lilt for grownups. With just the tiniest little bit of Columbus in the boil, we’ve reeled it all back in with just a tickling of bitterness to round this awesome IPA off for that signature Polly’s bite.","mixed":false,"abv":6.2,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/sg-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/summer-generator-ipa-6-2/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"The Weekend Radio","summary":"IPA","desc":"The Weekend Radio\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.8%\nIt’s back once again! We harp on all the time about how much we love the old school here at Polly’s whilst simultaneously embracing the new school. It comes as no surprise then that we noticed we had an absolute load of old school C hops in our cold store and a gap in our brew plans needing to be filled for release at the end of July.\nA fiendish plot came to fruition when we created The Weekend Radio; a five C-hop showcase of everything old school, featuring heavyweights Citra, Columbus, Centennial, Chinook and Cascade, all wrapped up in our new school fermentation techniques. The result is an IPA packed to the nines with strong citrus notes, but maximum drinkability and softness, echoing the OG craft beer titans, but sitting firmly in the present.","mixed":false,"abv":6.8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/wr-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/the-weekend-radio-ipa-6-8/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
