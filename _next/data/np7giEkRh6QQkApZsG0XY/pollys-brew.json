We’re already massive Sabro converts, so it was a given that we’d be adding this, but why not throw some Bru-1 into the mix – a hop varietal we’ve as yet not used at Polly’s. Named for an “ism” coined from the brewery when we discovered all these new varietals now available, we’ve supercharged this beer with a dry hop of 40kg, resulting in freshly cut pineapple aroma and flavours from Bru-1 complimenting the pina colada notes of Sabro, and accentuating the tropical fruit notes of Citra and Mosaic in an IPA that is mega juicy, mega hazy, and mega Polly’s.","mixed":false,"abv":6.4,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/08/BT-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/bonus-tracks-ipa-6-4/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Brand New Only","summary":"IPA","desc":"Brand New Only\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 7.2%\nWe don’t know quite what it is, or how we do it, but there’s something special that happens with our IPAs once they hit that 7.2% mark.
