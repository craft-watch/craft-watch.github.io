So, for this Northern Sounds collaboration with Fingathing, we’ve put together this ‘Can of Whup Ass’, a DDH IPA to showcase the best of Australian hops.\nWe started with a base of extra pale barley malt backed up with large volumes of naked and flaked oats and some maltodextrin, all there to flesh out the body and bring that desirable silky mouthfeel. In the whirlpool, there’s a small US contribution in the shape of some Citra Incognito, which is partnered with a big addition of Enigma T90, the dankest of the Aussie varieties but also contributor of some prominent passion fruit notes. At the back end of fermentation came a 28g/l dry hop led by Galaxy and Vic Secret, which enhances the passion fruit aroma and brings juicy tangerine, lychee, and ripe tropical fruit.","mixed":false,"abv":6.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/10_NMBC_1406_NorthernSounds_Fingathing-Comp2_V2_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/14-06-fingathing-can-of-whup-ass-australian-ddh-ipa","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"24.03 Tom J Newell","summary":"Ghost Venom // Young Master // Imperial Stout // Red Wine Barrel Aged","desc":"12% ABV // 1.120 OG // 100 EBC // 15 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), RYE (GLUTEN), Hops, Yeast\nThis third release in the Tom Newell series was originally brewed back in February, when jess and tom from young master brewery, Hong Kong, stopped by on their UK tour.\nYoung Master are at the forefront of craft brewing in Southeast Asia and carry a reputation for outstanding barrel-aged releases, so it was a no-brainer to work with them on something decadent.\nFor the base beer, we put together an adjunct- free, rich, and viscous imperial stout which puts the spotlight on the flavours of the malt. Starting with an English ale barley malt, we added Munich malt and flaked oats to build in the body and extra mouthfeel, and then selected a range of roasted grains, including chocolate rye, to achieve a deep, dark colour, plenty of dark chocolate and light roast coffee notes, and an extra touch of earthy spice. Finished off with some crystal rye plus medium and dark crystal barley malts for dark fruit and cinder toffee touches, we had a wonderfully complex stout on our hands, which after a month of fermentation and conditioning, was transferred to a selection of freshly emptied French Burgundy and Pinot Noir barrels for six months, to pick up the rich red grape, light oak and red cherry flavours they held.","mixed":false,"abv":12,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":7.15,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Dark"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/10_NMBC_2403_TomNewell_GhostVenom-10_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/24-03-tom-j-newell-ghost-venom-young-master-imperial-stout-red-wine-barrel-aged","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"27.01 British Culture Archive","summary":"Holidays In The Sun // DDH Double IPA","desc":"8.7% ABV // 1.082 OG // 7 EBC // 20 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), WHEAT (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), Dextrose, Hops, Yeast\nThis DIPA forms the first in a new patrons series in collaboration with the British Culture Archive. The series will be IPA focused, but also intended to showcase some of the progression in the UK hops over the past few years, pairing them with a US variety to show that homegrown varieties can deliver on many of the big, citrus flavours we love from the pacific northwest.\nFirst up we’ve selected Olicana, a variety which has been around for a few years now and still is up there amongst the forefront of UK hops. Olicana stands out for its impressive aromas of mango and passion fruit, backed up by nectarine and apricot notes, and a pleasant floral character. We paired this with one of our current favourite US varieties in Idaho 7, a real allrounder that can be relied upon for plenty of ripe tropical fruit of its own whether used hot side or in the dry hop. In this case, we went with both, as we loaded the whirlpool of this oat-filled NE DIPA with Idaho 7 before drying hopping with both varieties to a combined total of 26g/l.","mixed":false,"abv":8.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":6.95,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/09-NMBC-2701-BritishCultureArchive-Holidays_in_the_sun-15_200x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/patrons-project-british-culture-archive","brewery":{"id":"northern-monk","shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false}},{"breweryId":"northern-monk","name":"28.01 Leimai Lemaow","summary":"Astro Gary // Rainbow Astro Belt Sour IPA","desc":"6.5% ABV // 1.0735 OG // 6 EBC // 15 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), LACTOSE (MILK), Mango Puree, Raspberry Puree, Orange Juice Concentrate, Lime Juice Concentrate, Hops, Yeast\nFOR THIS NEW PATRONS PROJECT SERIES WITH LEIMAI LEMAOW, WE’RE GOING\nTO BE TAKING A TRIP TO THE SWEET SIDE.
