Utilizing mainly Mosaic in the dry hop, with a 15kg dry hop charge initially followed by equal 5kg mini-charges of Sabro, Citra and Bru-1, this beer bursts with heavy pineapple notes, with coconut and tangerine following in abundance, before mellowing out into a medly of berry notes from Mosaic, and finishing with crisp citrus thanks to our old dependable, Citra.","mixed":false,"abv":6.8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/10/FI-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/future-infinity-ipa-6-8/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Keeler","summary":"DDH Double IPA","desc":"Keeler\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Double India Pale Ale\nABV: 8.5%\nWe needn’t remind you that we love all things old school whilst simultaneously melding new school techniques into the beers we create. When designing the recipe for Fake Attentions, we noticed a pattern in that our use of the old school varietals in the dry hop bill was somewhat reserved, with the new school hype hops taking centre stage, and with that, the majority of the sensory notes. We thought “why not flip this one on its head and let an old school hop take the lead?” and Fake Attentions was born.

Maybe it’s our fondness of loading them with both new school and old school hops to give that mega juiciness alongside crisp, clean bitter notes that make them so drinkable; whatever it is, there’s just a little bit of magic that happens with our beers when they hit that 5.2% mark.\nLike, Forever – named for a remark made in the brewery during a particularly long double canning day – features a ten minute whirlpool addition of Chinook, before adding more again in the dry hop.

Originally our first foray into using everybody’s new favourite hype hop Sabro in one of our beers, version two sees us with six months worth of experience in the little quirks and idiosyncrasies of this incredible varietal.\nAmplified up to the max, Sabro brings a metric tonne of sweet, creamy, pineapple and coconut notes before being reeled in by an in-house Polly’s favourite in Citra to keep everything balanced.

Why not ramp up the hop bill to an insane 50kg, for a hopping rate of 24g/l – in other words, hop an IPA at the same rate as one of our DIPAs?
