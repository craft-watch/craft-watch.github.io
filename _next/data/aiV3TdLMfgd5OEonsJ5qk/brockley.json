The mini-kegs have a shelf life of 5 weeks, but once they are opened, it is best to drink the beer within 3 days.\nThe mini-keg is simple to operate. There is a link to an online guide on the keg. Or simply follow the following steps:\n1. Vent the Keg\nVent the keg by opening the red valve on top of the keg. Lift the red handle, and turn it anti-clockwise giving it a quarter turn\n2. Getting ready to pour\nPlace the keg on the edge of a stable, flat surface. Bend the red tab on the front of the keg towards you and pull out the tap. The stem will ease out of the keg.\n3. Pouring the beer\nHold a tilted glass under the tap. Turn the tap anti-clockwise to pour the beer. Pour the beer down the side of the glass.\n4. Close the Tap\nClose the tap by turning clock-wise. It is not necessary to push in the tap after every use.\nTop Tips\nOnce opened, the beer will stay fresh for up to 3 days as long as you keep the beer refrigerated.\nMake sure that the keg is cold before you serve your beer. If it is too warm, it may create a lot of foam when pouring.\nDELIVERY OPTIONS:\nFree beer delivery to residents of SE4, SE12 + SE13!\n£2 delivery for all other SE London postcodes!\n£5 delivery fee for the rest of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales!\nPlease leave your number in the order so we can arrange a good delivery time or leave your delivery request in the order notes, thanks!","mixed":false,"abv":4.1,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":24,"sizeMl":5000,"format":"KEG"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale"],"new":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b518ad_d3f11342ffc44bb79abf2228d6b0be2d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_100,h_100,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/b518ad_d3f11342ffc44bb79abf2228d6b0be2d~mv2.jpg","url":"https://www.brockleybrewery.co.uk/product-page/pale-ale-5l-mini-keg","brewery":{"id":"brockley","shortName":"Brockley","name":"Brockley Brewing Co","location":"Brockley, London","websiteUrl":"https://www.brockleybrewery.co.uk/","twitterHandle":"brockleybrewery","new":false}},{"breweryId":"brockley","name":"Pale Ale Bag In Box","desc":"This delicious beer was the first beer we brewed here at Brockley and has always been a permanent fixture on cask since it's conception.
