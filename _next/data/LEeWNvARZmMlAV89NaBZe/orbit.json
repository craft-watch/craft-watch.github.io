Named after the runoff area on vinyl records, with a nod to Seven (named for the 7” single) our Double Brown Stout which we have brewed in previous winters at Orbit.\nDead Wax is our take on a classic London Porter. Based on the late nineteenth-century interpretation of the style. Complex rich malt, with aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel and malty biscuit. More chocolate, coffee and black treacle on the palate.
