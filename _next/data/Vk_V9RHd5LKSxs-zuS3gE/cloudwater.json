It finishes with a low bitterness to let the hop aromas and flavours linger on your palate. (440ml can)\n1 x West Coast IPA, 6% - The West Coast IPA is a modern classic that changed perceptions of what beer could be, and paved the way for today's craft beer scene. Our own approach is informed by experiences working with trailblazing brewers and diving deep into their celebrated beers, so this delivers the hallmark layered bitterness and a clean, dry, resinous finish alongside punchy flavours provided by a blend of modern and classic hop varietals. (440ml can)\n1 x Hoppy Little Lager, 3% - Our most approachable and easy-drinking beer takes cues from both our Pale Ale and our Light Lager, to combine bright, zesty, fruity hop flavours with the light drinkability and refreshing qualities of low-ABV lager. A fine thirst-quencher, a delicious pause between stronger beers, or a great choice if you're watching your alcohol or calorie intake..
