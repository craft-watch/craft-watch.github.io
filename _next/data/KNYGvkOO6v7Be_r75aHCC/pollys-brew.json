Our second in this series is the shortest collaboration beer we’ve ever done – brewhouse meets office with Endless Festoon, designed by our own Head of Sales, Arron. A big fan of melding all things old school and new school into a smashed up hybrid, this beer features a tag team of new school hops in Azacca and El Dorado taking on old school stalwarts Citra and Enigma for a beer that pays homage to those OG beers without whom we wouldn’t be here today, whilst fully embracing the new school juicebomb vibe we’ve become so famous for. Stonefruits, tangerine and piney resin notes are about in this all out smasher of a DDH Pale.","mixed":false,"abv":5.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":false,"categories":["Pale","IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/endless-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/endless-festoon-ddh-pale-5-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Future Holds","summary":"IPA","desc":"Future Holds\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.5%\nSometimes the best thing to do is just to go with what you know best. We think we’re pretty good at brewing an IPA here at Polly’s HQ, and with Future Holds we decided to let our natural instincts just go wild. Extra Pale, Wheat, and oh so many Oats in the mash give all that thick, beautiful mouthfeel. Amarillo and Chinook dry-hop charges give that old school bite we love, with Citra and Sabro for new school mega juice flavours and aromas. Wrapped up in a huge slathering of LA3 for maximum suspension and an extra boost on the body; this is stereotypical Polly’s – high juice, low bitterness, and so so moreish.","mixed":false,"abv":6.5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/08/3-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/future-holds-ipa-6-5/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Little Patternist","summary":"Pale Ale","desc":"Little Patternist\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Pale Ale\nABV: 5.0%\nJust like how we love to scale up our beers, we likewise love to challenge ourselves to see if we can fulfil the flavour intensity and body of one of our IPAs, but reeled back to a sessionable strength.\nPatternist is and always has been the most underrated of the original three Augment beers, and we wanted to show it the serious love it deserves by showcasing those incredible El Dorado and Simcoe mango and pineapple notes, backed up with earthy bitterness, all condensed down into a super crushable, mega sessionable beer; perfected for sharing good times with (socially distanced) pals.","mixed":false,"abv":5,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.25,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["Pale"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/08/2-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/little-patternist-pale-ale-5-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Slow Repetitions","summary":"Double IPA –","desc":"Slow Repetitions\nRange: Augment\nStyle: Double India Pale Ale\nABV: 8.8%\nWhen you’re planning a DIPA, you go as big as you possibly can. Citra and Mosaic is a combination that we keep coming back to because it’s so so consistent. The combo that knocks it out of the park, runs, catches the ball itself and throws it back is paired up with a new hop varietal to Polly’s HQ in Idaho 7 – a hop that practically drips with juicy tropical and stone fruit notes, backed up with just the faintest amount of pine. We decided to balance this out with just a little bit of Columbus also thrown into the dry hop for that Polly’s bite, and create possibly the stickiest, sweet, and decadent DIPA we’ve brewed to date.","mixed":false,"abv":8.8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/08/1-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/slow-repetitions-double-ipa-8-8/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Summer Generator","summary":"IPA","desc":"Summer Generator\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.2%\nMosaic and Simcoe is a partnership made in heaven. Much like Dre and Snoop, Lennon and McCartney, and Han Solo and Chewbacca, they just go together like a hand in a glove. We wanted to improve on the wildly popular Originals version of Mosaic Simcoe, and have brought it up to Augment level with Summer Generator. Featuring twice the amount of dry-hop as the OG version, with a 40kg dry hop charge bringing all those incredible pineapple, mango and passionfruit notes to the fore, this is a beer that drinks just like Lilt for grownups. With just the tiniest little bit of Columbus in the boil, we’ve reeled it all back in with just a tickling of bitterness to round this awesome IPA off for that signature Polly’s bite.","mixed":false,"abv":6.2,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.5,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":false,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/07/sg-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/summer-generator-ipa-6-2/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"The Weekend Radio","summary":"IPA","desc":"The Weekend Radio\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.8%\nIt’s back once again! We harp on all the time about how much we love the old school here at Polly’s whilst simultaneously embracing the new school. It comes as no surprise then that we noticed we had an absolute load of old school C hops in our cold store and a gap in our brew plans needing to be filled for release at the end of July.\nA fiendish plot came to fruition when we created The Weekend Radio; a five C-hop showcase of everything old school, featuring heavyweights Citra, Columbus, Centennial, Chinook and Cascade, all wrapped up in our new school fermentation techniques.
