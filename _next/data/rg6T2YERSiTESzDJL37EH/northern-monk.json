For the return we worked with the same hops and yeast, seeking some consistency across the brews whilst also showing the versatility of ingredients and how they present differently through varying alcohol contents and brewing methods. We selected US varieties Mosaic and Azacca, as well as Australian variety Enigma, for the two brews.\nWe led with Azacca in the whirlpool, where it contributed distinct pine notes and sweet pineapple. We also included it in the dry hop to a lesser extent, letting the other two varieties lead and bring overripe tropical fruit, bubblegum and watermelon to the fore, with a classic dank West Coast character riding underneath. The grist of both beers features malted and flaked oats prominently for the silky mouthfeel they provide, and we used chit malt and maltodextrin to further boost the body of this lower ABV version.","mixed":false,"abv":4.7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":5.2,"sizeMl":440}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2213/3151/products/NMBC_1804_NorthSeaSession-SandyKerr-3_180x.jpg","url":"https://northernmonkshop.com/collections/beer/products/18-04-sandy-kerr-north-sea-sessions-burnt-mill-ddh-session-ipa"},{"brewery":{"shortName":"Northern Monk","name":"Northern Monk Brew Co","location":"Holbeck, Leeds","websiteUrl":"https://northernmonk.com/","twitterHandle":"NMBCo","new":false},"name":"24.02 Tom J Newell","summary":"Fudge Sundaze // Dancing Gnome // Cacao & Coffee Fudge Sundae Imperial Stout","desc":"12% ABV // 1.135 OG // 100 EBC // 25 IBU // 440ML\nINGREDIENTS: Malted BARLEY (GLUTEN), OATS (GLUTEN), LACTOSE (MILK), Demerara Sugar, Caramel, Cacao Nibs, Coffee, Vanilla Paste, Hops, Yeast\nIT WAS DEVASTATING TO HAVE TO CANCEL HOP CITY THIS YEAR, BUT THE COLLABORATIONS LIVE ON.
