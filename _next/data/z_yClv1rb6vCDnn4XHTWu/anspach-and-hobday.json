In the context of today's brewing, these bold, fruity flavours are more at home, and Ernest could yet prove itself as a valuable addition to the contemporary brewing world.\nThe English Pale series is designed to showcase new English hops. The folks at Yakima Chief Hops have supplied us with Ernest and Endeavour hops before they are released for general sale.\nEach beer focuses on a different hop and is brewed using the same simple malt bill and clean yeast strain.
