It has a distinct earthy dankness that counterpoints the fruity aromas. Like an overripe fruit, or, and bear with us here, a musty locker room. Don't let that put you off! It's worth acclimatising the palate to Simcoe. This beer is a good showcase for it, west coast style bitterness keeps it from cloying and delivers the hoppy goodness with balance.\nThe label for this beer is designed by legendary street artist Sweet Toof.
