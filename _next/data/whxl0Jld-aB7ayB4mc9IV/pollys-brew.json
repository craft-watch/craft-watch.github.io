Our owner Sean has taken the lead on this one, employing his pyramid dry-hopping technique to full effect in this maxed out, full on DDH DIPA.

Back once again for its third iteration and in our opinion getting better each time, Deluxe Edition is our celebration of all things El Dorado; a varietal with a backstory as mysterious as the mythical city it’s named after. With an aroma of ripe mango, papaya and, in our brewers opinion, Jelly Tots (yes, really), it tricks a drinker into believing they’re in for a hype juice explosion. By the time it hits the palate, all of those amazing citrus notes we love so much come to the fore and an all out attack of pithy bitter notes rock up to the party.\nA single hop, maxed out hop bill in tribute to one of our favourite varietals; El Dorado, we salute you.","mixed":false,"abv":7,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA","Bitter"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/del-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/deluxe-edition-ipa-7-0/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Ending Chapter","summary":"IPA","desc":"Ending Chapter\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.8%\nA recent trait of ours has been revisiting some of our favourite Originals range beers and giving them the full Augment treatment. The first version of Citra Columbus was a thing of sheer beauty, and a surefire hint of where things would eventually go with our beers. A pairing of two hugely distinct and classic varietals, both of whom have bold claims to be part of the reason we exist today, this incredible IPA melds everything we love about the old school with the new school hype train we’re proud to be part of. Citra takes the lead on this one with a 20kg dry hop charge, before a follow up of 10kg of Columbus for good measure. The result? An amped up, maxed out IPA full of those juicy tropical notes we love so much, backed up with piney and resinous hoppy notes.","mixed":false,"abv":6.8,"offers":[{"quantity":1,"totalPrice":4.75,"sizeMl":440,"format":"CAN"}],"available":true,"categories":["IPA"],"new":false,"thumbnailUrl":"https://craftpeak-commerce-images.imgix.net/2020/11/ec-01.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&h=324&ixlib=php-1.2.1&w=324&wpsize=woocommerce_thumbnail","url":"https://shop.pollysbrew.co/product/ending-chapter-ipa-6-8/","brewery":{"id":"pollys-brew","shortName":"Polly's Brew","name":"Polly's Brew Co","location":"Mold, Flintshire","websiteUrl":"https://pollysbrew.co/","twitterHandle":"pollysbrewco","new":false}},{"breweryId":"pollys-brew","name":"Fake Attentions","summary":"IPA","desc":"Fake Attentions\nRange: Augment\nStyle: India Pale Ale\nABV: 6.3%\nWe needn’t remind you that we love all things old school whilst simultaneously melding new school techniques into the beers we create. When designing the recipe for Fake Attentions, we noticed a pattern in that our use of the old school varietals in the dry hop bill was somewhat reserved, with the new school hype hops taking centre stage, and with that, the majority of the sensory notes. We thought “why not flip this one on its head and let an old school hop take the lead?” and Fake Attentions was born. With 20kg of Amarillo leading things alongside smaller additions of Citra, and even smaller additions of Mosaic and Azacca, this beer bursts with punchy orange, and floral notes, before the juice follows up from our new school favourites.

There’s just something about a 5.2% pale ale that makes it perfect as an after work beer. Maybe it’s our fondness of loading them with both new school and old school hops to give that mega juiciness alongside crisp, clean bitter notes that make them so drinkable; whatever it is, there’s just a little bit of magic that happens with our beers when they hit that 5.2% mark.\nLike, Forever – named for a remark made in the brewery during a particularly long double canning day – features a ten minute whirlpool addition of Chinook, before adding more again in the dry hop.

Pushed out of the way by its more aggressive contemporary Galaxy, we find that this incredible Australian hop has a lot of similarities to its countrymate, but in a much more balanced, easygoing way. We decided to put this thought process into practice with Now Here, No Where – amplifying up the hop bill to that of one of our standard IPAs, whilst keeping things at a relatively sessionable strength. The result is a pale ale that is positively bursting at the seams with pungent tropical pineapple notes.

Upon tasting our latest effort, Patina Effect, we finally got the line we were waiting for – “Lads, you’ve done it”.\nPatina Effect is our ultimate homage to the old school American brewers without whom we would not exist today. A reeled back dry hop bill of 15kg of Chinook and 5kg of Simcoe plays those old school floral notes perfectly against the 10kg Chinook whirlpool addition – all the resin, all the bite, but with maximum drinkability.

Imparting less bitterness is something we’ve been keen to explore in our beers, and we achieved this through bringing the whirlpool temp down, and whirlpooling for much less time and adding smaller additions of Enigma and Mosaic, meaning more hops for dry-hopping! Almost 40kg of Galaxy, Mosaic, and Simcoe ended up going into this beer during fermentation, and the results stand for themselves.
