It has a distinct earthy dankness that counterpoints the fruity aromas. Like an overripe fruit, or, and bear with us here, a musty locker room. Don't let that put you off! It's worth acclimatising the palate to Simcoe. This beer is a good showcase for it, west coast style bitterness keeps it from cloying and delivers the hoppy goodness with balance.\nThe label for this beer is designed by legendary street artist Sweet Toof.

Sessionable, with tropical aromas from the Mosaic and Amarillo hops, it is a juicy pale with a balanced bitter finish.\nWhen we first began experimenting with canning here at Pressure Drop, the end goal was always going to be Pale Fire in cans.
